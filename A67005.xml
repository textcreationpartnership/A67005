            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt, The PARENT is taught his duty, to teach it his child betimes, To heare, To ſpeak, To doe; when and where to put him to ſchoole; after that to a <hi>Calling,</hi> which muſt be fitted to his inclination, as a garment to his back; for the childes inclination makes the ſureſt indenture to binde him to his Trade. In all this he may be taught in a way (if the Parent will apply his minde to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and to put the more obſervation upon it) as plaine, eaſie and familiar as the way hee walkes in.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond, The CHILDE is taught to know himſelfe and <hi>God;</hi> To take direction from His mouth, for his ſafe paſſage here through all his Ages, and therein how to anſwer all his relations, that when he ceaſeth to live here, he may live for ever with the LORD.</p>

This the Author hath done in truth &amp; ſincerity, not making ſhew in the Title of more, then is not truly in the book. Some paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages there are in the book, perhaps too high, raiſed above thy reach &amp; capacitie; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy duty lies, and that is all along, there it is as plain as is the beaten way, if you come with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to obſerve, and mark it: if not, I know not what is eaſie, but our <hi>own way,</hi> and that tends directly to deſtruction. Truly, to ſpeak my
<pb facs="tcp:204556:3"/> mind what I think, this is it; That this time is the ſeaſon for this book; for probable it is, we wil harken to it now, becauſe we ſmart now; pain and ſorrow is upon us from what we fear, yea &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what we feel too: likely it is we will harken now, or never: And if we do ſo, we muſt needs learn, That all this evill is from our little houſe within the breaſt, and the greater houſe without. Let every man doe his own work, his duty, reform there, where God hath made him overſeer, then the work is done, the ſword will be ſtill. And this is the ſcope and purpoſe of the book. A word is enough to the wiſe, eſpecially ſuch, who are made wiſe by blows.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Triviall Buſineſſe hath made an Intruſion upon yours of weight: A very Schoole point (ſo in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) but worthy a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wiſe Mans Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even yours. I need ſay little of it, it is big-enough and can ſpeake for it ſelfe. An old and ordinary ſubject it is, but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, and in no ordinary way. I will ſay no more of it but this, and it is enough;
<pb facs="tcp:204556:5"/> It concerns a Parent <hi>Infinitely:</hi> Infinitely? yes; It directs a Parent, To Tender the Childe <hi>Seaſonably;</hi> To love it <hi>Truely;</hi> To Reſigne it <hi>Humbly;</hi> To Traine it up <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;</hi> ſo, as it may be of much uſe In and To his <hi>Generation,</hi> promoting the <hi>Glory</hi> of his <hi>Great Maſter</hi> as becometh, <hi>heartily;</hi> That Parent and Childe may rejoyce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether here, and here-after for ever with the Lord: of high and Infinite uſe this, for it leads to an happy <hi>Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The doubt is, how you will take the prefixing your Name hereunto: I cannot reſolve that; But what induced me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, you ſhall heare, and I hope, allow.</p>
                  <p>It is not to ſeek your patronage (as the manner is) for it hath licence to go abroad; and whether it finds kinde entertainment or no, is not the Burthen of my Care.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it to beg your hand (as the great Ambition is) to ſet me higher in the World, wherein, when Time was, and my thoughts were much above my worth, you ſhewed your readineſſe, and I forget it not: The Truth is, I have lived in ſo
<pb facs="tcp:204556:5"/> low a Station, and ſo long (and I thank God heartily for it, that it is ſo low, and for that known weakneſſe, which forced, and moulded my minde to it, and at length framed my minde ſo contentedly in it, for a great providence concurred here) that I have not ſo much as a thought, or minde, had I the opportunitie, to riſe higher. Nay I ever thought, ſince I could think to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (but it was once a ſad thought) that I was as uncapable of preferment here in the World, as a piece of Earth is to become a Starre; ſo I thought, and it was no vaine thought, for it made me, I hope, the more ambitious after that world, where, if my weight keep not down, I may be above the Starre in Glory.</p>
                  <p>It was not then either This or That; what then? I am now telling you.</p>
                  <p>I am a worthleſſe parcell of that houſe, whoſe chiefe Supporter fell firſt from the beſt part of his eſtate, and then, (which was the fall Indeed) from himſelfe: very ominous this to younger Brothers (ſaith a Noble <note n="a" place="margin">Verul.

                     <q>But it is otherwiſe in things wherein nature admitteth a latitude; for we may ſee that a ſtraight glove will come more eaſily on with uſe; And that a wand will, by uſe, bend otherwiſe

                  <p>By this I would gaine but thus much; That I might evince the neceſſitie of a vertuous educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inhance the worth of the ſame; I meane, that we might ſet a price upon it, and no ordinary one neither.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:204556:19"/> more, as he thinks himſelfe of more worth then a clod of earth. It hath ſuch a forcible operation, as hardly any length of time or contention of labour can countervaile it afterwards: we remember the old ſaying, the truth whereof is more ancient, then is the verſe:</p>

And he doth his work throughly; he doth not plant here a <hi>ſpot,</hi> and there a <hi>plat</hi> of ground; but he tils the ground all over, that what he can, and as the nature of the ground is capable, he may make all fruitfull. And ſo we muſt intend this buſineſſe, as we would that thing, which concerns the <hi>Parent</hi> and the <hi>Childe,</hi> more then any thing in the world beſides; yea, more then a World is worth; Being confident of this; <q>That all things by labour and induſtry may be made better then Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them; And that God ſo ordained it, That the induſtry of man ſhould concurre in all things with the Works of Nature, both for the bringing of them to their perfection, and for the keeping of them therein, being brought unto it. <note n="i" place="margin">See D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hack.

                  <p>This I have digeſted into two parts, each entire of themſelves; but yet as different in the ſubject matter, and manner of handling, as is the ſubject I would informe: In the firſt part, a Childe in its <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noritie</hi> and younger yeers; the ſecond, a Childe growne up: Both the one and the other, the ſubject of a Parents care, and charge, which in the <hi>firſt part</hi> is largely treated on with the manner or way, how he may diſcharge the ſame: The way is, to make the Childe know himſelfe, then to know that, which may <hi>be known of God</hi>

                  <p>This then is my ſubject now, even <hi>The good cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Childe;</hi> an old Theame, whereto little that is new can be added either for forme or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Yet becauſe it is a work daily repeated and of <hi>Infinite</hi> concernment to the Childe; And being a parent my ſelfe, I obtained of my ſelfe (naturally very indiſpoſed to my pen) to ſet downe out of ſome continued experience and ſome converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Children, and Books concerning that Theame, what I thought pertinent to that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; <hi>The furthering and improving that great worke.</hi>

                  <p> What now remaines as an introduction thereto, I branch under theſe heads. Firſt, making this my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſcope, (the good Culture of the Childe) and being to note ſome <hi>wants</hi> and <hi>Deficiencies</hi> therein, I ſhall firſt, briefly obſerve ſuch defects as my riper yeers have diſcerned in my own <hi>education,</hi> the trayning up my younger yeers, which may be of ſome uſe to others for prevention. Secondly, I ſhall note a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> naturall defect, which troubled me very much; For I thought it the greateſt croſſe in the world, but it proved no ſmall benefit. And this I muſt not paſſe over; becauſe it will be of large uſe both to the Parent and the Childe; a good introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Duty unto both. Laſtly, I ſhall ſet downe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> what perſwaded me to put my hand to this work; and that will be of force to engage every Parent upon the ſame bounden Duty and ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, (for ſo I make way unto it with ſome digreſſion) I had naturally <hi>Linguam impeditam,</hi> a ſtammering tonge: my Mother, who could love her Childe, and yet be wiſe (two things, they ſay, incompatible <note n="m" place="margin">Non concedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ſumul amare &amp; ſapere.</note>, but ſhe could do both, as all knew that knew her) was tender of me, and the more tender, the more my imperfection was. And ſuch diſcretion ſhe uſed in that caſe, as indeed ſhe did in all points touching her Children; A true <hi>Eunice,</hi> though having five ſonnes, She had not one <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;</hi> for inſtructions and prayers both, are too ſhort for that worke; Such diſcretion, I ſay, ſhe uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, that, had I found the ſame under thoſe hands, whereto I was committed, I perſwade my ſelfe I had every way thrived better then I did,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:204556:20"/> and in point of pronunciation (a chiefe point in a Scholler) I had not found ſo great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as afterward I did.</p>

                  <p> I have digreſſed a little here, but I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a Mother, and ſuch a Mother, barely ſo and no more.</p>
                  <p>From under her genttle and wiſe government I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> was put to Schoole, to one of the beſt note in all that Countrey; I ſhall point to the wants there, which my riper yeers have noted in my education then, for ſo our Learned Interpreter, <hi>Iunius,</hi> hath done before me.</p>
                  <p>I ſpent ſixe yeers and an halfe in the Grammer Schoole, trained up according to the <hi>bad faſhion</hi> (for we ſay, as <note n="o" place="margin">

It requires ſpeciall obſervation.</p>
                  <p>In all this time ſpent in Grammar (ſixe yeers is a great length in our ſpan) I know not which loſt me moſt time, <hi>feare</hi> or <hi>Play.</hi> I know I played away much of the time (for all the ſorrow) but, I know

                     <q>His <note n="q" place="margin">pag. 11.</note> minde, ſaith he, was fixed upon another devotion, ſo he minded the ſpeech no more then a Boy doth his leſſon, when he hath leave to play.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Feare works the ſame effect that play doth. If the Maſter be as ready to ſmite, as he is to ſpeake (as too many ſuch there are) the Boyes minde is fixed upon another devotion, how he may ſave himſelfe; his eye is upon the rod or hand, and all his obſervation is how he may award the blow. As for other obſervations, which his leſſon would yeeld, they muſt ſtay a fitter ſeaſon for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when the <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Scholler</hi> both are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fitted and tuned, the one to give, the other to take inſtruction. And let him, whom it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, well conſider this: for it concerns him very much, and the Childe, whoſe good he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, as much and much more, whereof more in a fitter place, onely this I adde here.</p>
                  <p>A Boy will finde out many ſhifts; it is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters wiſedome not to put the Childe to it, for it will ſhew its wit in nothing more, then to hurt it ſelfe; I know it, for I was witty enough that way, and ſo, amongſt other defects, I made my tongue the more imperfect, which may teach the Maſter now to deale tenderly and gently with the Childe upon point of inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>A Maſter muſt maintaine an <hi>awefulneſſe</hi> in the Childe, elſe little will be done; and he muſt be as carefull to ſuppreſſe <hi>feare,</hi> and the working of it,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:204556:22"/> ſpecially then, when he would give inſtruction, elſe no good will be done; We may note what Wiſdome ſaith, certainly it holds true in ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeers; <hi>feare</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall note a Defect which I may be bold to cenſure; A fundamentall one it is, yet not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly mine, as that it is not common to the moſt, now, as it was then, ſent to the Colledge as I was, before I was fitted. There we ſhall finde helps from other Arts which will give <hi>Forme</hi> to <hi>Matter;</hi> But if we want <hi>Matter,</hi> what ſhould we do with our <hi>Forme?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was put to Logick and Rhetorick before I was prepared or fitted for either. <q>Thoſe grave Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, (as the Noble Scholler <note n="u" place="margin">2 Book. 99. lat. pag. 75.</note> ſaith) the one for judgement, the other for ornament, doe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Learner ripe for both; elſe it is, as if one ſhould learne to weigh, or meaſure, or to paint the winde. Thoſe Arts are the rules and Directions how to ſet forth and diſpoſe Matter: And if the minde be empty and unfraught there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; if it hath not gathered that, which <hi>Cicero</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Sylva &amp; ſupellex,</hi> ſtuffe and variety to begin with thoſe Arts, it doth work but this effect; That the wiſdome of thoſe Arts, which is great and Univerſall, will be made almoſt contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, and degenerate into Childiſh Sophiſtry.</q> So ſaid that noble Scholler, who hath not a word too light.</p>
                  <p>But empty, and unfraught though I was, yet to theſe <hi>Arts</hi> I was put, and my benefit there-from was anſwerable; ſo little, as that I ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:204556:23"/> thoſe Defects. For Defects, which grow up with us in youth, are as hardly amended in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time, as the errour in the firſt concoction is corrected in the Second. And yet, if I ſhould ſay, that many were then, and now are, ſent to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie more empty and unfraught then I was, I ſhould ſay but the truth.</p>
                  <p>I did not caſt away my howers there, though for want of good order and method in my ſtudies, I ſpent not my time there to much purpoſe. I fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Read the L.

                  <p>The next defect I ſhall note, (for there is uſe in it alſo) is this; I loſt the fruit of diſputation quite; The benefit whereof is no little to a Boy, if he be not (through the default of the Moderator) a right Sophiſter, contending about Goats haire, which is Childiſh Sophiſtry, a vaine jangling about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and of nothing comes nothing: or if they contend not with blows, and bad language, I mean, as once it was with hard iron, in ſtead of ſolid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.

I was fitter for the laſt of the three, for a ſick man likes a ſilent Phyſician, who hath skill to cure him, not words to weary him; he is in paine, words put him to more paine. The truth is, I could thinke upon no courſe, but either to <hi>digge</hi> or to <hi>begge,</hi> ſo I reſolved on that, which had moſt labour and leaſt ſhame, to labour with my hands; but that ſhould be in a ſtrange land; and thither I went twice, wherein, though I laboured not with the hand, yet I was fed. All this while, God took a gracious way
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:204556:25"/> with me, if I could have ſeen it: even to make me nothing, and to make me know it; but that is a mighty work for an Almighty hand; and I was framing to it, for I looked upon my ſelfe, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt helpleſſe fellow in the world; My Tongue, I thought, was as the <hi>Rudder</hi> to the <hi>Ship,</hi> which muſt bring in and carry out all my Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and that was broken. So I lay like a Ship, that had neither Winde nor Tyde; <hi>Sedit dum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuat ne non ſuccedat.</hi> I ſate ſtill, becauſe I thought it to no purpoſe to goe forward. How much of my precious ſand runne out, while my thoughts were troubled about nothing, or that, which was quite out of my reach! how was I toſſed, like a Ship, in a Storme of my own raiſing! and (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) though toſſed much, I ſailed nothing: my feare of ſucceſſe was the <hi>Remora,</hi> and hinderance to ſtay and ſlugge the Ship from further ſailing: it was the great <hi>Arreſt</hi> and <hi>prejudice</hi> of further progreſſe or diſcovery. So while I was ſeeking my ſelfe (the great ſinne of the World, ſelfe-ſeeking) I loſt my ſelfe; and when I would guide my own ſteps, I fell into a <hi>Maze,</hi> whence I could finde no iſſue; and for <hi>proviſion</hi> I thought it unpoſſible, when I thought on my <hi>Wilderneſſe,</hi> and I could not but thinke of it, for in a <hi>wilderneſſe</hi> I was.</p>
                  <p>While I was thus moyling, and troubling my ſelfe about Gods Charge (ſo it was) how I ſhould be fed to morrow, and clothed to morrow, that had ſufficient for the day; The Lord beheld the wrigling of the worme, and forbare to cruſh it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my <hi>intermedling</hi> with <hi>His charge</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:204556:25"/> (which is to keep and feed his people) and the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of my owne, which is to <hi>give all faithfull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;</hi> And ſo, as in <hi>Pauls</hi> paſſage, He brake the Ship, yet brought ſafe to land; He croſſed my friends deſignes, and daſhed all our projects, and placed me in ſuch a calling, and in that place, which was leaſt thought of. And in all this, there was nothing but Grace and goodneſſe; A gracious hand, a good providence, and now I can track it.</p>
                  <p>That very inſtrument hath brought in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, which I thought impoſſible to be; And in ſuch a place hath God provided for me, that is of the beſt note; whereas, if I could have found the way, I would have crept into a mouſe-hole.</p>
                  <p>That is a happy Infirmitie, which makes a man ſtick and cleave to God; that depreſſeth man, no matter how low, ſo it advanceth God: An hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie weakneſſe that makes the creature <hi>leane,</hi> cling, and rowle it ſelfe upon Him, in Whom is <hi>everlaſting ſtrength.</hi> There cannot be ſo much want in Man, as there is helpe in God; and helpe He will, if we can depend and waite upon him; And in the concluſion we ſhall ſee and ſay, <hi>He hath done all things well</hi>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:204556:28"/> hath this comfort, in caſe of miſcarriage, That he he hath <hi>ſteered</hi> his courſe according to the Rules of Right Reaſon, and by the Compaſſe of Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>In caſe of defects and wants in the Childe; we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> muſt learne ſubmiſſion to Him that made it ſo: We muſt not ſtrive with our Maker.

There muſt be great care taken here. Vilifying words hurt much and ſad the ſpirits. As we are taught touching the Parts of our body, ſo touching our Childe (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be infirme and defective) The more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie and uncomelineſſe it hath, the more weakneſſe of parts; the more honour and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement let it have; for, we ſhall finde the poore Childe apt to diſcouragement. A Parent muſt ſee to it alſo, that his weake Childe be not ſlighted, by his Brothers or Siſters, which is too ordinary. How deepe ſoever Children are in our affections, and one deeper then the other, yet is it a point of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion to <hi>ballance</hi>

All doe helpe, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry leaſt finger comes in with its grace, and hath its ſhare, as well as the formoſt, though it hath not the like ſtrength, nor can it adde much to the furthering the worke:</q> Juſt ſo with Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and then we have the ſcope of the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which tends but to this; That we uſe all gentleneſſe towards the weake Childe, and that we give it no diſcouragement, but praiſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement rather above its proportion. This is the third leſſon.</p>
                  <p>We have obſerved both from former and latter experiences; That Parents and Children both, are great troublers of themſelves, becauſe great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectours, and able well enough, they thinke, to guide their owne courſe. He that will tell his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation muſt ſay thus; That Parents doe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily deſigne their Children, being yet young, (whereof more in a fitter place) one to this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and another to that; The third and youngeſt (the weakeſt alſo both for Nature and parts) to the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> as if it were as eaſie a matter to make the Childe a <hi>Miniſter</hi> (I ſpeake in the Parents Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect) as to teach him the art of cobling ſhooes. But ſo he hath deſigned them, and accordingly projects for them, and ordinarily as croſſe, as he ordered his Dinner, who put his pottage into a Sieve, and his bread into a platter: not according to their nature and ingeny, which muſt be looked unto; but as the Parents purſe is, and the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards preferment leadeth. The Childe alſo will be but little behinde the Parent, <hi>ſhort ſpirited</hi> and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:204556:30"/> all for the preſent, He hath been drawing <hi>Maps</hi> of his deſires, and hath calculated his owne inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſees his fitneſſe for that condition of life, his Parent hath cut him out, and deſigned him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: And if all things were as ready, as the Childe thinks himſelfe; if the place, whereof the Parent hath the Advouſion, were but <hi>vacant,</hi> that he might ſtep in, how well he could fit it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it alſo in his conceit? Such <hi>bubbles</hi> theſe young folke are, ſpecially if they have taſted of the Arts, and are put into good Clothes; then they think all things elſe are anſwerable to the vanity of their mindes, which fills them, and pleaſeth them, making them think of themſelves, above that which is meete; That they are ſome <hi>great ones</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 8. 9.</note>.</p>
                  <p>This is the folly, which we may too ordinarily obſerve both in the Parent and the Childe, both imitating Children: For what elſe are theſe things which they have fained to themſelves, and drawne ſuch faire pleaſing <hi>Maps</hi> of, but like <hi>clay-caſtles,</hi> and <hi>Pies,</hi> which Children have ſet up now, and will downe anone?

For He onely knows His compaſſe, and will ſteere ſuch a courſe, as ſhall be beſt for the Parent, and Childe both, if they can expect, and waite the Lords time and Anſwer. And for the better ſtaying the Parent from making <hi>haſte,</hi> and perſwading with him to pluck downe theſe high and vaine thoughts, like Caſtles in the Aire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any foundation, wherewith he troubles and diſquieteth himſelfe in vaine, touching his Childe, Let him take theſe Directions, which are brought to my hand touching this point.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We, who are Parents, muſt take ſpeciall care about our <hi>Generall</hi> Calling, how we anſwer that great and honourable name, which is called upon us, ſo likewiſe for our Children. Thoughts heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt buſie us: And herein we ſhould remember this rule; <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is a matter rather of <hi>Grace</hi> then of <hi>Gifts;</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> then of <hi>Parts.</hi> Gifts, may come from a more common work of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and more for others then our ſelves: Grace comes from a peculiar favour of God, and ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:204556:31"/> for our owne good. And ſo if the Parent direct the Childe alſo, he ſhall teach it a Trade, which is ſurer then houſe or Land.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For a particular <hi>Calling,</hi> we muſt be very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as in behalfe of our ſelves, ſo of our Children, That we walke not above the parts and Graces we ſee in them, for then we ſhall put them into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condition, then ever God ordained them for: The iſſue whereof will be diſcouragement in themſelves, and diſgrace from others. As a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted Calling, warranted, I meane, by the Word of God (where of in a fitter place) is no ſmall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for comfort: ſo the fitneſſe of our parts for this <hi>Calling,</hi> what ever it be, is the beſt warrant that any man hath, that he is Called thereunto. And he muſt remember, That no Calling is ſo meane, but a man may finde enough to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for: And meane though it be, yet faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will commend a perſon in the loweſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life; And unfaithfulneſſe will poure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the height of Dignity, as a <hi>ſpewing</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Glory.</hi> Our Maſter in Heaven, regards not how high a man is, but how faithfull he is <note n="e" place="margin">God hath given thy Brother a <hi>great</hi> gift, to thee a <hi>little</hi> one: He hath propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the work accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and ſo ſpares thee.

                  <p>The maine work then of a Parent with his Childe at this point, is, to take a right <hi>Scale</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> of his Childes parts, and ſo anſwerably to fit it with a fit Calling. The Parent muſt labour by all means to <hi>hide Pride</hi> from the Child, I meane, The Parent muſt beat it off from <hi>vaine-glory</hi> and <hi>ſelfe-conceit</hi> (young folke have the beſt opinion of themſelves, becauſe they diſcerne themſelves worſt) and to ſhake it off from <hi>ſloth,</hi> that <hi>Moth</hi> and

                     <hi>Canker</hi> of our Parts. The one <hi>(Pride)</hi> will make the man and Childe both, to lay open their weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; The other <hi>(Sloth)</hi> will make them not to know <note place="margin">Qui ſe neſcit, uli ſe neſcit.</note> their ſtrength, or not to put it forth.</p>
                  <p>And let the Parent, having done his endeavour, comfort himſelfe with this, That how weake or unſerviceable ſoever his Childe ſeemes to be (if not doubly deformed) in reſpect of his parts; yet, there is no member, but it is fitted with ſome abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to do ſome ſervice in the body, and by good nurture, and manurance, may grow up to a greater meaſure. And let him conſider this with it; That, as in the body naturall, the moſt exalted part, the <hi>Head,</hi> hath need of the loweſt, the <hi>foote:</hi> ſo there is not the greateſt perſon, but may have uſe, both of the parts and graces of the meaneſt in the Church.

How ſhall I make my Childe rich and high in the World? Where ſhall I finde a place where he may have great wages and little work?

He ſtands upon His credit ſo much, that it ſhall appeare we have not truſted Him in vaine, even when we ſee no appearance of doing any good, when we cannot diſcerne by all our <hi>ſpialls,</hi> the leaſt ſhew either for <hi>proviſion,</hi> or <hi>Protection.</hi>
                     </q> We remember who were very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous for their Children, and becauſe they could not provide for them, nor protect them neither, therefore periſh they muſt in the wilderneſſe: We muſt remember alſo; That the Lord took care of thoſe <hi>Children,</hi> and deſtroyed thoſe diſtruſtfull <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> who thought there was no <hi>path</hi> in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe becauſe they could not diſcerne any: nor meate to be had there, becauſe their hand was too ſhort to provide it.

There is no <hi>uncertainty</hi> in God, but all <hi>Certainty,</hi> as in Him is all <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> all <hi>Strength:</hi> We apprehend that there is a <hi>Certainty</hi> in man and an Uncertainty in God, for, if we obſerve our hearts, we Truſt Him leaſt; but that is our <hi>Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> and <hi>Weakneſſe.</hi> There is all <hi>uncertainty</hi> in men, even in the beſt of men, in <hi>Princes,</hi> place no Certainty there: There is all Certainty in God, as in Him is all Wiſdome and Strength; put we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence there; Caſt we Anchor upwards, Commit we all (but in well-doing) all we have, and all we are, into his <hi>everlaſting Armes,</hi> Then aſſuredly, we ſhall finde a ſtay for our ſelves, and a portion for ours, Proviſion and Protection both: He is all to us, and will be ſo, when we are nothing in our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much touching my <hi>Wilderneſſe,</hi> and Gods providing for me even there, though I tempted him ten times. I call it a <hi>wilderneſſe;</hi> for ſo I may, becauſe ſo, my fooliſhneſſe in my way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare made it: And Gods proviſion for me was very remarkable, and therefore to be remembred for the Parents ſake and Childrens too; of great uſe and concernment to both. Indeed, he that can ſay
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:204556:34"/> no more of his Travels, but that he paſſed through a <hi>Wilderneſſe,</hi> hath ſaid little to commend his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, but much to magnifie the <hi>power</hi> of That Hand, whereby he had a ſafe Convoy through the ſame. It is a poore and worthleſſe life, ſuch mine is, that hath nothing worthy to be remembred in it, but its <hi>Infirmities:</hi> But yet there is nothing ſo magnifies Gods <hi>power</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> as mans <hi>weakneſſe</hi> doth. <q>When I ſhall give account of my life, and caſt up the ſumme thereof (ſaith <hi>Iunius</hi>

                  <p>Now I come to give the reaſon of my paines, in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:204556:34"/> all this which follows, and what ingageth a Parent unto this Duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>If this conſideration come home and proves ſeaſonable, I ſhall then ſet all in a readineſſe, and in order, that when Death comes, I may have then, no more to doe, but to welcome it, and ſhut the eye, and depart <hi>tanquam Conviva Satur,</hi> as one that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:204556:35"/> hath made an improvement of life, and hath hope in Death. That was my firſt conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

So then; The ſame hand, that was reacht forth to this <hi>fruite,</hi> reacht it alſo to the <hi>fruite</hi> of their <hi>loynes,</hi> wherein that <hi>fruite</hi> was, <hi>ſeminally,</hi> as branches in a common ſtock. And thus the Childrens <hi>teeth were ſet on edge;</hi> ſo the next verſe tels us; <hi>And Adam begat a ſonne in his owne likeneſſe,</hi> his owne indeed; that is, With that generation, Sinne was alſo derived: for he begat now not the Body onely,

Is cuſtome no ſmall matter? ſaid one, who was ſhort of a Chriſtian. Shorten the childe in its deſires now, ſpecially, if it be haſty, and cry, and will have it. Then, ſay ſome, the childe muſt have it; ſay I, no, but now it ſhould not. Shorten it here, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe it cryes: if he have it, give him it when it is ſtill and quiet, Correction rather, when it cryes. Let it not have its will by froward meanes; Let it learne and finde, that they are unprofitable, and bootleſſe. A childe is all for the preſent, but a Parents wiſedome is to teach it to waite; Much depends on it, thereby a Parent may prevent <hi>eagerneſſe,</hi> and ſhortneſſe of ſpirit, which elſe will grow up with the childe, and prove a dangerous and tormenting evill.</p>

I will tell my obſervation; I have knowne ſome children, who might not be ſhortned, leaſt it ſhould ſhorten their growth; what they would have, they ſhould have, for they were but children; theſe have lived to ſhorten their Parents dayes, and their own, and to fill all with ſorrow: for afterwards, they would not be ſhortned, becauſe they were not while they might. <note n="a" place="margin">

So I am ſlipt into another <hi>Age,</hi> and what is the juſt period and limit thereof, I cannot define.</p>
                     <p>The time of Child-hood and Youth, is much as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents can <hi>time</hi> the <hi>beginnings,</hi> as was ſaid: As they order and handle the childe, ſo they ſhall finde it. As it is diſciplined, it may quickly and ſeaſonably, with Gods bleſſing, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow <hi>Childiſhneſſe,</hi> and then, <hi>Child-hood;</hi> and as it may be neglected, you may know that by its Childiſhneſſe, it is a <hi>Boy</hi> ſtill. So the limits of this age, I count, are in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents hand; according as their care is, more or leſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding will this time of child hood be, longer or ſhorter. It matters much therefore how the childe is diſciplin'd, and taught.</p>
                     <p>2. Here then is worke for the Father alſo, whom we have not hitherto exempted; and for the Mother, no leſſe worke then ſhe had before. Father and Mother both little enough, and, for the fathers ſpare houres, a full employment; but none more neceſſary, or whereunto he can be more engaged. The childe is now out of hand, as we ſay, and quickly out of ſight, and as buſie as an <hi>Ant</hi> in the Summer, but it is not out of minde; The Mother is quickly calling after it, and ſeeking for it, for ſhe knows the childe will be in harmes-way; for though it be a little more out of the Mothers hand, it was never leſſe in its own.</p>
                     <p>3. I cannot queſtion the Parents care concerning the childes out-ſide, the body; and there care doth well, but there may be too much, and prepoſterous that care may be, and inordinate. We adorne the out-ſide commonly (ſaith <hi>Clem.</hi> of <hi>Alexandria)</hi> as the Egyptians their Temples, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly <note place="margin">

                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:204556:46"/> very ſpecious and beautifull; but if you looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <note place="margin">Ch. 2. ſect. 3.</note> there was an ugly <hi>beaſt:</hi> ſo we adorne the <hi>body,</hi> when the <hi>ſoul,</hi> the <hi>All</hi> of a man, is neglected. The <hi>ſoul</hi> calls for its due alſo; we cloth the childes body, the <hi>ſoul</hi> ſhould not be naked; we feed the <hi>body</hi> and cheriſh it; the <hi>ſoul</hi> ſhould be cared for and cheriſhed alſo, and in the chiefe place; for the <hi>ſoul</hi> is the cauſe that the <hi>body</hi> is regarded: ſuppoſe the <hi>ſoul</hi> taken from the <hi>body</hi> but one houre, and how loth are we to caſt an eye toward the <hi>body,</hi> which before was ſo lovely in our eye. A great reaſon this (though there is a greater then that, as the preciouſneſſe of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and the <hi>price</hi> was paid for it) why the <hi>ſoul</hi> ſhould be regarded, and in the firſt place. All is then, what the Parents care is, concerning that which is the <hi>man</hi> indeed; And therein the care is commonly too little, no way anſwerable to the hopes they have of their childe. They will ſay yes; They intend the childes good, nothing more; and the way they intend alſo conducing thereunto. But what ever they ſay, it muſt appeare by what they do; for good <hi>intents</hi> are no better then good <hi>dreames,</hi> except they be put in execution. So their care is upon try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; what they do, in way of promoting the childes good, muſt evidence it as the ſureſt witneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Now that the childe can go and ſpeake, it can imploy its minde and body; now the faculties of both are awakened, and declare themſelves; Now muſt the Parents be doing, if they will evidence their care; and they muſt conſider well what they do. The childe imitates ſtrangely, it is taken, like an Ape, wholly by <hi>example.</hi> The Parents practiſe (I meane the Parent at large, him or her that hath the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of it) is the childes <hi>booke,</hi> it learnes by it, ſo it ſpeaks, ſo it heares, it is faſhioned after it; it is chatechized by it; It is its <hi>Schoole,</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> The Parents houſe muſt promote the childe in point of information, more then can <hi>Schoole</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> though well provided in both; yet Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents be too ready to referre all thither, and ſo put all off from themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Aſſuredly, it is the cauſe of much miſchiefe and ſorrow
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:204556:47"/> in the world, that the parents think themſelves diſcharged <note place="margin">Ch. 1. ſect. 3.</note> of their duty towards their childe, when they have charged the School with it. Yet thus it is commonly, for ſo experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tels us, which is the <hi>Oracle</hi> of Time, and makes all wiſe, that obſerve it. The mother thinks that the School muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But ſo the mother thinks, that ſhe ſhall do her part; for ſhe is reſolved that to the Maſter or Miſtreſſe ſhe will go, and the childes arrand ſhe will do, and ſhe ſweares it too, if ſhe live to the next morning; If it pleaſe God (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> relate her words being well acquainted with them) the Maſter ſhall know the rudeneſſe of the childe, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly and undutifull it is, and how ſlovenly too; Nay the Maſter ſhall know, it will neither give God thanks, nor ſay its prayers. This is her errand, and when that is done, ſhe takes it, that ſhe hath done her duty. In the mean time (I mention no other decay) the childe grows ſo naſty, that you would ſcarce take an egge out of its hand. So much the Mother commonly neglects the childe, whom ſhe loves ſo dearly well, and ſo much deſires its well doing.</p>
                     <p>And for the Father, he is upon ſuch deſignes, as may enlarge his heaps, or poſſeſſions, which he means to caſt upon the childe, like ſo many loads of <hi>Muck</hi> thrown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <note place="margin">

Again, the Parent is ſo wiſe, that he will till and manure the field, he looks to reap a good crop from; but here he thinks to reap though he ſow not: and that the childe will be good, how bad ſoever the fathers example be, or how little ſoever his care which he takes, in the well nurturing of his childe.

Note we this, for the cloſe hereof, and to inſtruct <hi>father</hi> and <hi>mother</hi> very much. The childe had, anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently amongſt the Romanes, three ſet over him, the <hi>maſter</hi> to inſtruct; the <hi>governour</hi> to correct; the <hi>parent</hi> to do both, <note place="margin">Preceptor, Padagogus.

                     <p>4.

And if the Maſter can unteach that, he hath done a good work indeed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parent muſt know, that while the childe is in his houſe, the principall and chiefe work about the promoting the childe is his; while the childe is under the parents eye, it is properly their charge: and as they diſcharge it, ſo the childe thrives, and proves every way. It is their buſineſſe, and of the greateſt weight and conſequence that can be thought of, whereof they muſt give an exact account, yea of every part and parcell of this <hi>ſeed time.</hi> And when all is done, humane ſufficiencie is inſufficient to provide againſt the evill that hindreth; or to uſe all the means that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the childes good; but yet we muſt do our utmoſt in theſe two principall points;</p>

                     <p>The firſt was the mothers onely childe, therefore her dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as fondly handled by her, and diſordered, as we need imagine. To ſchoole he came, that he might be out of the dirt. So the rod was ſpared, the mother had her deſire and expectation. The childe proved accordingly, not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the mothers hope, but very anſwerable to her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of breeding. About a yeere after, the childe angred the mother, and the mother ſtruck the childe; he runs to the fire, and up with the fire forke, and at the mother he makes, at leaſt he threatned. The mother haſtens to me, as much diſpleaſed with the childe, as ever before ſhe was pleaſed with it. It was well for the childe, for it made him ſtand in awe, though in no great feare of the mother. More depends on it, but I muſt not ſet it down; we have as much from it, as we need to make uſe of; <hi>The mother would not have her childe ſtruck with a rod, to let out his folly; the childe offers to ſtrike the mother with a fire forke.</hi> Such was the Retaliation, and ſo juſt.</p>
                     <p>2. Another there was, and the mother had the ſame hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and much like was the iſſue at the firſt, but ſince, much worſe, for ſhe would have ſent this ſonne to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt Ilands; any where, ſo he were on ſhip-board (that would keep him in compaſſe, which a priſon did not) or out of her ſight. But of him no more, for he did not live out halfe his dayes, his intemperance kill'd him; and, they ſay, he dyed penitent. We have enough from this example alſo, whereof to make much uſe, which is this: That childe, the Parent ſo doteth upon; that he would not have it out of his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:204556:53"/> ſight, nor willingly ſuffer the winde to blow on it, is the childe, that will be an <hi>eye-ſore,</hi> and the <hi>hearts griefe,</hi> unto whom the Parent is moſt likely to ſay, <hi>Stand out of my ſight, thou art a griefe unto me,</hi> the greateſt that <hi>can</hi> be thought of.</p>
                     <p>3. The third is as followeth, a ſhort relation, but full of bitterneſſe; as I finde it in <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Sermon 33. Where thus we reade. <hi>There was one</hi> Cyrillus, <hi>a man mightie both in word and work, but a very indulgent father. One ſon he had, and but one,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ad fratres in Eremo.</note> 
                        <hi>and becauſe but one, he muſt have his will, ke muſt not feele the rod, he muſt not be croſſed.</hi> He might have what he would, and do with it what he liſted, he tooke his libertie, and more; More then an <hi>inch</hi> was given him, he tooke an <hi>ell,</hi> as <note place="margin">Indulgent ſibi latiùs. Iuven.</note> the manner of youth is; that will not ſatisfie, which the Parent allowes, though that may be too much. He might have money, and he might ſpend it how he liſted: <hi>Plautus</hi> tells us, we may more ſafely put a knife into a childes hand then money; And he that allowes the childe money, leaſt the childe be put to baſe ſhifts, will allow the Parent to ſtint the childe, and to call it to account, where and how it ſpent its allowance. But this childe gave no account either of his purſe or time, he might go forth and return when he pleaſed; ſuch libertie he had, and ſo <hi>left to himſelfe.</hi> We read on in the ſtory, That he brought <hi>his mother to ſhame.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 24 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> But thoſe words are too ſhort. We read more then ſo, even that the Divell did rule mightily in that childe of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for thus we read. <hi>This childe came home drunke, and in the day time; he violently and ſhamefully abuſed his mother great with childe; he killed his father out right, and wounded two ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters mortally.</hi> Hereupon, ſo it is related, a great aſſembly was called: That all Parents hearing ſo ſad and weeping a Tragedy, might for ever, beware of this looſe and ſottiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, which breeds the childes ruine and the Parents woe.

                        </gap>ſe are the conſiderations, and becauſe they are of ſuch importance, we will give the ſumme of them, which is this.</p>
                     <p>5. If our affections be too in ordinately ſet upon any earthly thing, it commonly cauſeth a loſſe of the thing ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:204556:53"/> doted upon; if <hi>Ioſeph</hi> lye to cloſe to the Parent, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſhall be hid from the Parent.</p>
                     <p>2. Then the ſorrow will be as much in loſing, as the comfort was in poſſeſſing, in an even proportion.</p>
                     <p>3. Or if the childe be not hid; yet, comfort ſhall be hid; There will be <hi>barrenneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. And then a croſſe follows, perhaps a curſe. We may make a recognition of what was laſt ſaid, in theſe words.</p>
                     <p>God provideth ſome <hi>Gourdes</hi> to refreſh us in our Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: we muſt not be <hi>exceeding</hi> glad of them; That were to ſet up the Gift as an Idoll in the heart, and to ſhut forth the Giver: and if ſo then God prepares a worme, He wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Gourd; and then that very root, which yeelded ſo much ſweet before, yeelds ſo much ſower after; for as our gladneſſe did exceed, ſo will our trouble be exceeding, when the thing, we tooke ſo much comfort in, is withered. Or if not ſo, then worſe then ſo, for that ſo indulged comfort proves commonly a croſſe; it is the very root of gall and bitterneſſe; the very <hi>ſtock,</hi> on which commonly the Lord doth graft the ſoreſt miſery, and ſharpeſt ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Look we then to our affections, that they be not too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and exorbitant: Remembring ſtill, That affections ſet at liberty, are like children left to themſelves, they will make us aſhamed, and worke our ſorrow. I conclude with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Boltons</hi> words; if they be well conſidered, they will be as Banks to turn our affections back, and hold them in, that they do not over-flow their juſt bounds.</p>

It is not to be doubted, but this diſtemper is to be found in Parents. And we may note, That they, who are moſt indulgent, are, if provoked, as they will ſoone be, moſt ſevere and violent in their correction, as if they had that abſolute and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall power over their children, which once the Parent had, and much power yet they have, all the <hi>craft</hi> is in the wiſe uſing of it. But they doe not uſe it well now in their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they will miſcall the childe ſtrangely, and ſtrike they know not where, and kick too; I ſet down, what mine own eyes and eares have told me. They do puniſh, perhaps, not <note place="margin">Laudabat ſe non ſine cauſa, ſed ſine modo.</note> without cauſe (as was ſaid of one in another caſe) but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all meaſure, as if they were not children but ſlaves.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:204556:54"/> while the Parent is ſo eager upon the childe, it is not then teachable, not counſellable, for, as was ſaid, <hi>feare betrayeth all its ſuccours;</hi> nor is the Parent in a fit caſe to teach or counſell it: for, what can be expected from a man in a <hi>fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;</hi> Anger is fitly called ſo.

In the midſt of the dance (and ſo the Muſick was ſpoyled) away they whipt the Bride, the friends ſaw her no more, only her cloathes they found, for the Divell had no quarrell againſt them; ſo goes the Story, And if ſo, there was a feaſt turned into mourning, and a raſh wiſh paid home. Much credit is given to the relation; but this waight certainly it hath; To bid us beware of that <hi>adverſary,</hi> who, like a roaring Lion, ſeekes whom he may deſtroy, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but his commiſſion; when that is granted, he will be as quick, as he was with <hi>Iob,</hi> to the uttermoſt extent of his chaine.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:204556:69"/> what a bleſſing they have in their hands, therefore they cannot priſe it. But looke to them herein, ſo ſhall you prevent a great evill, and a great provocation, the treading under foot Gods good creatures: In an houſe, where I once lived, the children had their trencher full, and their hands full, and mouthes full, all at once: Some was ſpilt on the ground, and ſome upon the trencher, for commonly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens hands are ſo foule, that none will eate after them. The parents did not well obſerve it, and ſervants worſe. There was plentie, and where that is, it is hard to pick up crums; ſickneſſe came, and tooke away the parents; and the Pariſh the children, one friend takes one, and the ſecond another; at home was nothing, there had been too much ſpilt.</p>
                     <p>This may minde us of Chriſts rule, and practiſe, <hi>That the broaken meat be taken up,</hi> and nothing kept ſo ill, that it is not fit for the priſoners basket. We may alſo conſider, If God ſend us cleanneſſe of teeth (which we may feare) it will adde much to our ſmart, That we now want, what we once ſpilt, or ſuffred ſo to be, or worſe; That, when the fuller furniſhed our tables were, the fuller of vomit and filthineſſe they were; The fuller our paſtures, the more, like beaſts, we trod down with our feet, and kicked with our heele; The more Gods bleſſings were, the more we forgat the Giver; The more ſleightly we eſteemed, the more careleſly we caſt away the fruits of His bountie towards us: The parent muſt remember, and he muſt remember the childe of it often; That the hungry ſtomack calls out for bread, bread, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it for dainties; Yea, unto that ſoule, every <hi>bitter thing is ſweet</hi>

In King <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds dayes, in the eighteenth yeare of his raigne 1234, many periſhed for want of victualls. In the ninth yeare of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, 1315. the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie was ſuch, that horſ-fleſh was accounted great cheare, and ſome eat their own children; and the theeves in priſon did pluck in pieces thoſe, who were newly brought in.

                     <p> It is a knowne ſtory, and to be obſerved; That a very proud King, delighted much in his childe hood, to put out the <hi>eyes</hi> of <hi>Quailes;</hi> This King carryed himſelfe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, with ſuch pride and inſolency, that he had his deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from it; and delighted himſelfe ſo much in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie and bloud, that the people expelled him out of their Citie and Countrey, with proteſtation never to receive any King againe: ſo they changed the name of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <p>§ 1. <hi>In the morning when thou riſeſt;</hi> There is no ſeaſon in the day fitter for inſtruction, then is the <hi>morning,</hi> nor ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler thereof. Now the Sunne is returning and begins to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare on this our ſide of the Globe, making all light and lightſome about us, oh how comfortable is it to ſee the light, and how ſafe to walk by it! Before, darkneſſe covered the earth, and masked the face of the ſame; and then we could not diſcern in what order things lay; nor what way to ſettle about them; Many doubts we have, and feares in darkneſſe, ſome reall, though the moſt imaginary; for it is our nature in darkneſſe, if we finde them not there, to frame them there. Our way in the dark is uncertain and hazardous, full of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:204556:73"/> danger. Learn hence, What <hi>darkneſſe</hi> is to the outward man, ſo is <hi>ignorance</hi> (the key of ſome mens <note n="l" place="margin">Reade our <hi>Jewell.</hi> 27. <hi>Art.</hi>
                        </note> Religion) to the inward; I know not whereat I may ſtumble, nor wherein I may fall; nor, falling, how dangerouſly I may fall, nor how irrecoverably; Onely this difference there is, and it is a great one, betwixt him that walks in darkneſſe, and him that lives in ignorance, the darkneſſe of the minde; He that walks in darkneſſe, walks charily and cautelouſly, feeling his way with one hand, and fencing his face, and the choice ornament thereof, with the other, becauſe he hath no light to guide himſelf by, and he knows he is in darkneſſe, and is ſenſible of the danger. Therefore it falls out ordinarily, that he ſcapeth and preventeth danger, becauſe he is ſo ſenſible of the ſame; what I feare moſt is like to do me leaſt hurt, for it is likely I am prepared for prevention.</p>
                     <p>It is not ſo, with a man walking <hi>in ignorance,</hi> and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde; He goes on boldly and confidently, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the proverb is, he diſcernes no danger, he cannot fear it. The former by his carefulneſſe may not fall; The latter, by his ignorant careleſeneſſe muſt needs fall; it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be otherwiſe: The former, if he fall, he will ſurely riſe again; for he knoweth, he lieth not where he would; The other falling lieth ſtill, and can never riſe again till a light appeare unto him; the one knoweth where he is and what he doth, the other knoweth nothing as he ought to know.</p>
                     <p>There is one, &amp; we may call that one, as Satan called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Legion,</hi> for that <hi>one</hi> is <hi>many,</hi> who holdeth <hi>ignorance</hi> to be the mother of devotion; but that one is the mother of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and thence it is, that ſhe prevaileth with them, and deceives ſo many, for, as ſhe hath gained, ſo ſhe holds all ſhe hath gained, by the <hi>tenure</hi> of <hi>ignorance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a farre greater difference betwixt a well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſcientious man, and an ignorant perſon, then is betwixt a man walking in the Sun and working by it; and another walking in the night when neither Moon nor Starre
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:204556:74"/> appeares. The one clearely ſetteth forth the other; he that worketh by the Sunne ſeeth all cleare about him; where he is, and what he doth, and why he doth it; he that is in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, diſcerneth nothing, nor can do any thing as he ought to do; and yet, which is much worſe, living in the darkneſſe of ignorance, he diſcerneth not his danger.</p>
                     <p>He that doth in any part underſtand what <hi>ignorance</hi> is, and the fearfull effects of the ſame (this ignorant man doth not) will pray for himſelf and his (as they who were upon the ſea, and in great danger, <hi>They wiſhed for the day</hi> 
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Acts 27. 29.</note>) <hi>Send forth Lord, thy light and thy truth, through thy tender mercie, let the Day-ſpring from on high viſit us.</hi> Thus he wiſheth for the day. And now, This <hi>Day-ſpring</hi> from above hath viſited us; we, that once walked in darkneſſe have ſeen a great light, and the glory thereof we have ſeen, as the glory of the onely Sonne of God: upon us who dwelt in the ſhadow of death hath this light ſhined. Oh happy are the people then, that are in ſuch a caſe? how bleſſed are they to whom the Sun of righteouſnes hath appeared? they are children of the day, and of the light; it is day with them, alwayes day, though neither <hi>Moon</hi> nor <hi>Starres</hi> appeare, that is, though they finde no influence from the earth, or regions bordering thereupon.</p>
                     <p>But clean contrary it is with them, to whom this <hi>Sunne of Righteouſneſſe</hi> appeareth not, or againſt whom they ſhut their eyes (as ſome will do though, as the proverb is, we ſhould ſhew them the <note n="n" place="margin">

How miſerable are the people, that are in ſuch a caſe! they ſit in darkneſſe, as they do on the other ſide of the globe, when the Sun is with us: nay worſe then ſo, they dwell in a land dark as Aegypt was, even in the land of the ſhadow of death; For, though they have the Moon and Starres upon them, I mean the confluence of all outward things, yet they ſit in darkneſſe, in deep darkneſſe. For as the Sun is to this outward world, ſo is the Lord Chriſt, the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to the world of beleevers; without Him it is all dark,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:204556:74"/> with Him, it is ſtill light, like the land of <hi>Goſhen; happy are the people, that are in ſuch a caſe; bleſſed are the people, whoſe God is the Lord; Send forth thy truth, Lord, and thy light, and through the tender mercy of our God, let the</hi> Day-ſpring <hi>from above viſit us.</hi> This may take up our thoughts very ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, when the darkneſſe of the night is paſt, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the day is come; And it may ſet an edge upon our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after the principall thing, <note n="o" place="margin">Eccleſ. 2. 13.</note>

                     <p>2. The day is come, and the ſunne appeareth; ſo the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour thereof hath appointed, that it ſhould know its riſing, and thereby to renew and and refreſh the face of things. The inſtruction is, touching the <hi>might</hi> of <hi>His power,</hi> and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of His grace, creating light in the Soul, who at the firſt, brought it out of the wombe of darkneſſe; and cauſing the light of comfort to ariſe unto His ſervants in the darkeſt night of affliction; for it is He alſo, that curneth the <hi>ſhadow of Death into the Morning</hi>

                     <p>And this affordeth a righteous people, an hint for a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:204556:75"/> glorious dependance; they know, that as ſure as the <hi>morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> follows the <hi>night;</hi> ſo the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare with <hi>healing under his wings:</hi> for, if the Sun know his appointed time, much more the Lord knoweth His; and the Sun of righteouſneſſe His ſeaſon, when and how to comfort thoſe, that wait for Him, <hi>as they that wait for the morning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. The appearance of the Sun inſtructs us touching the glory of His appearance, and the exceeding joy, the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous ſhall be filled with all at <hi>that Day:</hi> For, if it be ſo comfortable to ſee the <hi>light;</hi> how comfortable will it be to ſee Him, that is the <hi>Light</hi> of that <hi>light?</hi> If this <hi>elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Sun, be ſo glorious and full of light; what then is the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſſe?</hi> And if it be ſo comfortable to ſee this light; how raviſhing <note n="ſ" place="margin">

                     <p>But for the wicked, it is not ſo with them; for the <hi>morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is now unto them, as the <hi>ſhadow</hi>

                     <p>4. We learne againe, how ſinne and ſorrow, can ſower our bleſſings, and make us diſreliſh the greateſt earthly comforts; Amongſt them, the chiefeſt is the light, yet to him, that is hurried or oppreſſed with his ſinne, this light is grievous; And to him, that is in paine, the day is doleſome: as he is wearyed with toſſings in the night, ſo is he tyred in the day, complaining thereof; for, <hi>In the</hi>

                     <p>5. The Sunne, though it be in an infinite diſtance from us (to our finite underſtanding) yet doth it ſend its influence downward (cleane contrary to the nature of light or fire) unto the loweſt of creatures; Thus, This great light doth: as if the Great Creator thereof had charged it thus to do; <hi>Send forth thy light againſt the nature of the ſame; caſt thy beames down towards Man, to guide and direct him there; do ſo, for, for him thou waſt made: His candle</hi>

And this ſinne is clearely evinced and reproved by the language of the Sunne and all thoſe creatures, that in their ranks obey their Maker and ſerve us.

                     <p>The leſſon then is, At our tables we muſt begin this deniall, ſo we ſhall frame unto it the better in other things of greater importance. We may note here; that naturally we are very ſhort ſpirited, all for the preſent; we are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of waiting, ſoon tired there, even almoſt before we begin, though the Lord hath ſaid, The <hi>waiting of the meek ſhall not be forgotten;</hi> And though the Lords manner is to make His children <hi>wait,</hi> putting a long date to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of His promiſes, when yet His deferring is no empty ſpace, for in that ſpace much good is done, even a fitting for the promiſe, as, while the ſeed lieth in the earth, the time is not loſt; for the hard winter fitteth for the more hopefull Spring. But I ſay, ſo the Lords manner is, to inure unto a patient waiting, to ſtay, as in the caſe of <hi>Lazarus</hi> 
                        <note n="k" place="margin">John 5. 6.</note>, and with thoſe, He moſt loveth, <hi>two dayes longer,</hi> when the extremity ſeems greateſt; ſo long, as we may think, with <hi>Martha,</hi> that the ſeaſon for help is quite paſt. We may take notice how ſhort our ſpirits are, by that we reade of the two ſiſters, but eſpecially of the three diſciples <note n="l" place="margin">Luke 24. 21.</note>. The third day was come, and not fully over, and yet but ſo long deferring their hopes, weakened their truſt; <hi>And to day is the third day.</hi> By them we may learn how ſhort our ſpirits are, and how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient in waiting. But the ſhortneſſe and eagerneſſe of our ſpirits appeares in nothing more, then in thoſe things, which preſſe upon the neceſſities of nature. We ſee ordinarily the bread and the cup are put to the mouth before ſo much as a thought (the quickeſt thing that is) is conceived of Him, who hath ordained both for our comforts. And we may
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:204556:82"/> remember how hard it preſſed upon <hi>Eſau;</hi> yea and upon the good old Prophet <note n="m" place="margin">1. Kings 13. 15.</note>, who was eaſily ſeduced upon the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>bread,</hi> which ſheweth us the eagerneſſe of our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; and how <hi>peremptory</hi> the demands of an hungry ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack are, which a man can no more rule, then he can his tongue; but He, who reſtrained the ravenous <hi>lion</hi> from tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>aſſe</hi> and the <hi>Carkeiſe,</hi> (mark it) can reſtrain our eagerneſſe this way, and give us the command of our ſelves, for the better performing His command in caſes extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and in ſuffering great matters, when He ſhall call us unto it. I think now of the extremities which famine drives unto, and they are ſcarce utterable by them, that never felt them: I think alſo, how ſoon our very neceſſaries, which we have riotouſly abuſed, and careleſſely caſt at our feet, may be taken from us. But then I think withall; that in theſe extremities, wherewith Gods deareſt children may be exerciſed and preſſed, they do ſo look up to Gods hand and ſo reſt upon it, that they certainly finde the ſame hand as gracious towards them in ſuſtaining them, as it was powerfull in holding the mouth of the lion, in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned caſe: So as, though the extremitie be great, yet they do not put forth their hand to wickedneſſe, not to ſuch <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid</hi> and <hi>bloody diſhes,</hi> as we reade and heare that ſome in their extremities have done. If God take away the meat, He can take away the ſtomach alſo, as the Martyr ſaid; or reſtrain the rage of it, ſo as it ſhall not touch the carkeiſe, or ſuch unclean things. But we cannot tell what delicate wanton perſons may do in their ſtraits; nor how far our unmortified luſts may carry us. If we are in no part crucified to the world, and have the world in no ſort crucified to us, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie may prove unſupportable; want of neceſſaries will preſſe ſore upon thoſe, who alwayes have lived at the full, and fed themſelves without feare; and could never part with ſo much as any of their ſuperfluities. They who <hi>feed</hi> themſelves <hi>like beaſts</hi> (ſaith <hi>Clem. Alex)</hi> very likely will <hi>walk</hi> and <hi>do like beaſts</hi>

Our tables are as full of exceſſe as before, and fuller of ſurfeit. So the fool goes on and is puniſhed, he cannot lay things to heart; but they that are wiſe, do heare the voice of the rod, and do fear before it, walking humbly with the Lord: They have got command over their ſpirits, and are got from under the power of the Creature, by denying themſelves a little in this, and a little in that: Now in this leſſer thing, ſo making way for greater, ſo as, when the <hi>rod</hi> of their affliction ſhall bud out again, which they expect, nay when the Lord ſhall turn the former rod (which wrought no reformation) into a <hi>ſerpent,</hi> ſo that it ſtings like a <hi>ſcorpion;</hi> they may feel the ſmart thereof, but the poyſon thereof ſhall not be deadly.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much to teach us <hi>abſtinence;</hi> and to get command over our ſelves, that we be not brought under the power of the creature, which will help us much to <hi>poſſeſſe</hi> our ſouls in <hi>patience</hi> in the day of trouble.

                     <p>Now touching our children, the leſſon is this; we muſt

There are in this our walk, I mean, in the view of the creatures, two extremes; and two ſorts there are, who fall foule and ſtumble at them: The one ſort are they, who think to riſe higher by the ſight of the creatures, then the creatures can carry them; and ſo, by prying too farre with their own light, they make their <hi>philoſophy vain;</hi> and become vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart is darkened; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot riſe above nature, it cannot elevate herſelf above herſelf.

                        <hi>hound</hi> her (as the noble Scholler phraſeth it) ſhe can leade us, and muſt needs do ſo, from the foot-ſtool on earth, to the <hi>Chaire</hi> in heaven; but when ſhe hath done ſo, and when in our curious purſuit and diſquiſition our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is wound up ſo high, yet is it but a naturall underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill: ſo as we do in this ſearch and enquiry tumble up and down, like a ſhip at <hi>anchor</hi> in the waves of our own reaſon and conceits, for it is not poſſible, as the ſame Noble ſcholler ſaith, for us to make a perfect diſcovery of the more remote and deeper parts of knowledge, ſtanding the while, but upon the <hi>flat</hi> or <hi>levell</hi> of this naturall knowledge.</p>
                     <p>There is another ſort, and they are the moſt, who ſtumble at the other extreame; They behold the creatures, the works of nature, of God rather, but do no more but behold them; they ſtay and dwell upon the ſuperficies, or out-ſide of the work, further they paſſe not, either to what is within, or to what it tends unto. There are two moſt ſimple and <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> trades of life, ancient and once honourable trades both, though now, as was ſaid <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Preface pag.</hi> 21.</note>, <hi>Cooks</hi> are of more eſteem becauſe the old <hi>ſimplicitie</hi> of life and livelihood are out of faſhion: Two trades I ſay, and they maintain the ſtate of the world, The one of <hi>ſhepheardie,</hi> the other of <hi>husbandrie:</hi> They who are verſed herein, ſhould be, if they are not truants, well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed men, for their books, which are full of inſtruction,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:204556:88"/> are ſtill in their eye; and they are ſtill poring upon them: They live ſtill in the view of heaven, and of the earth; the one tending his ſheep, the other driving his oxe and horſe: and yet, though thus they do, yet have they gained no more true underſtanding, from their obſervations in either, then the ſheep or oxe have, which they tend and drive.</p>
                     <p>Experience tells us, that the <hi>ſhepheard</hi> and the <hi>husbandman</hi> are the moſt ignorant perſons in the world. Though yet I know very well, that both theſe do know what <hi>ſheep,</hi> and which ground yeelds them moſt profit, and the way they know how to make them moſt ſerviceable that way; and all this they may know and yet remain moſt ignorant not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, as for the moſt part they are; no more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding have they in thoſe chief things, and leſſons, which the beholding the earth and the heaven might yeeld them, then the oxe or the horſe have which they follow (which was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Dearings</hi> complaint long ſince.) And whence this ſtupiditie or groſſe ignorance? There can be no other reaſon hereof but this; that they do behold the creature and no more; as (ſo ſaith the proverb) <hi>An oxe looketh on a gilded gate:</hi> Their ſenſes report no more to the minde, but that they have ſeen it; no more. A fault carefully to be avoided, for he that is unfaithfull in earthly things, ſhall never have greater matters committed unto him; and he, who carrieth a negligent eye or eare, towards the works and voice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gathering no inſtructions thence, though the characters are moſt legible there, and her voice cleare and audible, ſhall finde no more capacity in himſelf for higher truths.</p>
                     <p>There is a place in the Apocrypha, which is worth our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of, it will help to lead us the way betwixt thoſe extreames, it meets alſo with that ſtupiditie even now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and corrects the ſame.</p>

                     <p>Here now we have our leſſon, and the way to make our walk profitable; <hi>we</hi> muſt <hi>apply our minde</hi> to that we ſee; and we muſt meditate on the Law of our God. That is the man, who will learn by every thing, that hath inured and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed his heart to compare earthly things with heavenly; to <hi>trade</hi> his <hi>ſpirit</hi> to heavnely things by earthly occaſions. He ſhall be made wiſe, who hath a gift (it muſt be given from above) to be heavenly; that is, to make every creature (which is the work of a ſanctified fancy) a <hi>ladder</hi> to heaven; to turn ordinary properties of the creature, or common oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to heavenly meditations: This, I ſay, is the man, who will profit by his <hi>walk;</hi> being now in the open view of the heaven and the earth, and obſerving Gods great works in both.</p>
                     <p>To conclude and to inſtance, ſo making the thing plain, that man ſhall gain much by his obſervations, who hath but ſo much underſtanding, as ſeeing a <hi>ſheep</hi> before the ſhearer, to ſee alſo the <hi>meek-abiding</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> of the Saints; ſeeing an <hi>ant,</hi> a <hi>lillie,</hi> a <hi>raven,</hi> to think on a <hi>providence;</hi> ſeeing an <hi>oxe</hi> knowing his owner and his crib, to think, what is the duty of a reaſonable creature; obſerving the <hi>ſtork</hi> and the <hi>ſwallow,</hi> and our houſhold <hi>cock,</hi> all exactly obſerving their ſeaſon, and I think, the laſt obſerving it almoſt to a minute, To learn from theſe, and to get (as was ſaid of the children <hi rend="sup">z</hi> of <hi>Iſſachar) underſtanding</hi> in <hi>the times,</hi> and <hi>to know what Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>

                        <hi>ought to do;</hi> He that can do ſomuch (through Him that ſtrengtheneth all, and in all, he can) he ſhall be made wiſe by his obſervation of the creatures, for he ſets his minde to the thing, and the Law of God is in his heart; he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive profit by every thing, and teach others how to profit alſo: ſo I come to the third particular; How to teach the childe to ſpell nature &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>3. Childehood and youth, are ages of fancy. Therefore the Father (I mean a father at large, maſter or teacher, he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:204556:90"/> hath the relation of a Father) muſt make great uſe of the childes ſenſes, for they have the beſt agreement with its fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: hereunto the book of the creatures is very ſubſervient. They ſpeak to the ſenſes, and the ſenſes make report to the minde. So in this way every place will be the childes ſchool, for every where it will meet with its leſſon, and no leſſon plainer and more legible to a childe, then what he findes in the volume of the Creatures.</p>
                     <p>This is a truth not to be doubted of; That parent teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beſt and ſooneſt attaineth his end, the promoting his childe, who verſeth the childe moſt in the open view of the creatures; So he cannot alwayes do, but this he muſt do alwayes, as he intends his childes profit; When he cannot carry his childe abroad to view the creatures, he muſt, what he can, bring the creatures home to the childe; ſo ſhall he make the book in the childes hand, what ever it be, more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible: For this the parent ſhall finde, that, where he comes ſhort in making repreſentations to his childes eye, there the childe will fall ſhort in his apprehenſion. Nothing comes into the underſtanding in a naturall way, but through the doore of the ſenſes: If the eye hath not ſeen that, we are ſpeaking of, it can make no report of it to the minde. The ſpirit of the childe, as I may ſay, is faſhioned and moulded to the pattern and modell of that it looks upon. And note we, then the childe goes on with eaſe and delight, when the underſtanding and the tongue are drawn along, like <hi>parallel</hi> lines, not one a jot before another. It is <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> his rule, the ableſt man in that way, that yet the world hath taken notice of. And this alſo the parent ſhall the more eaſily effect and with quicker diſpatch, if, (when he hath laid the book of the Creatures before the childes eye, and is reading the lecture from thence, he ſhall put the lecture into queſtions, and make the childe, not an hearer onely (that is the old manner) but a party in the buſineſſe: It will much enliven, and quicken the childes fancy, to ſee it ſelf joyned as a party in the work, though its little it can
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:204556:90"/> do. A parent muſt queſtion his childe, and in a faire way take an account of him; ſpeaking wholly, is loſt labour. The Tutour in Xenoph. <note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib</hi> 1. <hi>de Inſt. p.</hi> 34.</note> for a lecture to his ſcholler Cyrus, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth this queſtion; <hi>A great youth, having a little coat, gave it to one of his companions of a leſſe ſtature, and took from him his coat, which was the greater; upon which he demanded his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> Cyrus <hi>anſwered, that it was well, becauſe both of them were thereby the better fitted: But his maſter ſharply reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him for it, becauſe he conſidered onely the fitneſſe and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience thereof, and not the juſtice, which ſhould firſt and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially be conſidered,</hi> that no man may be enforced in that, which was his own.</p>
                     <p>And this no doubt is an excellent manner of inſtruction, ſaith <hi>Charron;</hi> and it is probable, this was the manner, which the <hi>Iewes</hi> took for the inſtruction of their children: <note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 6. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>And when the childe ſhall aske thee,</hi> thou ſhalt ſay, thus and thus: But how if the childe did not ask? then ſure enough the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent did ask the childe, or help the childe how to ask. If the childe did not queſtion the parent, the parent did queſtion the childe. We would have the childe ask and enquire; for it is a true rule, <hi>He that doubts and asketh moſt, he profiteth moſt: And he that enquireth after nothing, he knowes nothing,</hi> ſaith another. But the parent will finde the childe very ſlack and backward this way; Few children there are, who make any further enquiry, but <hi>When is the next holy day?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here the parent muſt help, and give the hint of a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As it requireth ſome ſenſe, to make an anſwer not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; ſo it asketh ſome knowledge, to demand a queſtion not impertinent; it exceeds the skill of a childe. Therefore there is no queſtion, but the parent muſt help, and give the hint of a queſtion at the leaſt, and that will give an hint to further inſtruction. It is paſt all queſtion; that it is an excellent way in teaching, to put the lecture into queſtions: We have our great <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> a preſident unto us, whom they found in the Temple, ſitting among the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, both hearing them, and asking them <note n="c" place="margin">Luke 2. 46.</note> queſtions. It is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:204556:91"/> then no novel way, but ancient, and authentick; though now, as the beſt things are, grown out of uſe and faſhion. And it ſufficeth to point onely at this way of <hi>queſtioning the childe,</hi> ſo making it a party, which will help it very much to reade in the volume of Gods works, and to profit by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was the third thing.</p>

Of all the works of Gods hand, it is the moſt admirable, both for the wayes thereof, and operations there-from. I know not which we could want of all the creatures of God, but, I am ſure we cannot want aire: My <hi>veines, arteries, nerves,</hi> all are quickned by it, it is the ſoul of our breathing. If I had all that heart could wiſh, all were nothing, if I wanted aire; and aire muſt be good, and wholeſome too, or elſe all would be as good as nothing. Therefore it is Gods great <hi>doale</hi> to the world, all ſhare in it; And it hath a kinde
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:204556:103"/> of ubiquitie; It is every where, and yet we cannot ſee where it is, ſo like it is, the likeſt of any to a ſpirit (for it is the moſt <hi>bodyleſſe</hi> body) by which name it is ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; As we call that, for which we have no name to expreſſe its ſtrange vertue and efficacy. If I could go to the furtheſt parts of the earth or ſea, there it is; If I could climbe up to the uppermoſt region, there it is alſo; If I could deſcend into the loweſt vaults and caves of the earth, there it would be found. It is as inſeparable from a man as his conſcience is, ſhut the windows, barre the doores, draw the curtaines all cloſe, yet you can as eaſily ſhut out your conſcience as it; The aire will come in, it will viſit us in what condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; And if this may be ſaid of the creature, what then of the Creator? He that hath given the creature ſo large a circuit, three regions of the world, hath yet appointed it its bounds; But take we heed, we limit not the Holy One of Iſrael. By this creature we aſcend neerer to the Creatour then by any other; but yet we come infinitely ſhort: we muſt not compare God to any creature, for to Him nothing is like.</p>
                     <p>The aire is pure and cleare of it ſelf, and in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but, if it were ſo to us, it would not be agreeable to ours; it would be then too rare and thin, and not agreeing to our earthy, and compounded bodies; therefore, for our benefit and comfort, ſometimes for our puniſhment too, it receives alteration, from beneath, or from above, or from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; thence it is, that moſt times the aire refreſheth, and ſometimes poyſoneth; ſometimes temperately cooling: ſometimes again with heate ſcorching.

                     <p>2. From the different operations of the beames, I note, That the diverſitie of ſubjects, the Sun worketh upon, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifies the effects. And this is but a concluſion of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alſo; how unclean ſoever the place is where they come, they alter not, but work diverſly, according to the matter they work upon; If upon clay, it is hardned; if upon waxe, it is ſoftned; if upon a dung-hill, the ſtinking vapours more offend; if upon a garden of ſweet herbs, the ſweet ſavour more refreſheth; if upon good fruits, they grow for the uſe of man; if upon weeds, they grow to humble him: The alteration is here below in ſublunary creatures, the Sunne changeth not. Hence we learn how unreaſonable that dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is, which the Wiſe-man telleth us of; <q>The fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord <note n="h" place="margin">Prov. 19. 3.</note>.</q> This ſhould not be ſo: but clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; For, when a man perverteth his own way, and then <hi>fretteth againſt God,</hi> It is, as if the dung-hill ſhould blame the Sun, from whence nothing can come but <hi>light,</hi> as from a dung-hill an unſavoury ſmell, which is the more ſenſible and offenſive, the clearer and more piercing that light is: or as if a man, through inconſiderateneſſe taking a fall, ſhould fret againſt the ſtone. If God leaveth us to walke in our own wayes, or recompenſeth our wayes upon us, we ought not to charge Him <hi>fooliſhly,</hi> but to charge our ſelves with folly; and if we have learnt ſo much, we have learnt a ſhort, but a great leſſon, <q>For it will make us continually to walk <hi>humbly</hi> with our God, and a continued humilitie,</q> is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued adoration of His Majeſtie; and the ground-work of an holy life, which is a continued prayer <note n="i" place="margin">Vera humilitas perpetua adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, pia vita per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petua oratio.</note>.</p>
                     <p>3. We may note again; That theſe beames of the Sun in its circuit do paſſe through many pollutions, and yet not polluted therewith, but remaine pure and cleane. The Sun
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:204556:110"/> worketh upon inferiour bodies, and cheriſheth them by light and influence, yet is not wrought upon by them, but keepeth its owne luſtre and diſtance; The Father maketh this uſe hereof; How much more then, ſaith he, could the <hi>Sun</hi> of righteouſneſſe dwell with fleſh and <hi>pitch</hi> His tabernacle with us <note n="k" place="margin">

                     <p>This ſhews us alſo, who are heavenly, and the beautie of a well ordered ſoul: It thinks nothing in the world of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient worth to put it out of frame: ſuch a ſoul is inſtructed what it ſhould be; It ſhould rule over things beneath, and not be ruled by them; like the Sunne, it ſhould be under the power of nothing beneath it ſelf. But this intire eſtate, this freedome from pollution is reſerved for an higher place, where all corruption ſhall be done away: for now the ſoul, having ſo much earth about it, and ſo much of earth within it, which is the cauſe of defilement, it cannot mixe with things of the earth, and not be polluted, it cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome tainture there from; But yet ſtill, the ſoul that is heavenly, ſtriveth after perfection, and in deſire, would be in ſome proportion like the Sun in his race, which works upon inferiour things, but is not wrought upon by them: It deſires to carry it ſelfe like the Sunne, above formes and ſtormes, in an uniforme way, in a conſtant courſe and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, like it ſelf, ſutable to its own dignitie, and keeping its diſtance.

                     <p>Again, the light of the Sun is in ſome part hid from us, by the interpoſition of the Moon, ſometimes of the clouds, often in the day; and halfe of our naturall day quite inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the interpoſition of the earth, as in our night.

                     <p> This may teach us not to judge of heavenly things with earthly eyes; for they are not fit judges ſometimes in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters; we know the Sun doth ſhine, when we have not the leaſt glimpſe thereof; and we muſt acknowledge, that God doth ſhine forth in glory; though we have no diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.

The brightneſſe of His excellency can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gazed upon, nor muſt the height of His power be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.

It is a fit time for a man now, to retire into himſelf alſo, and to conſider not ſo much his little world, the ſeverall parts, powers and faculties of the ſame (Though that is a point of great conſideration, and would fill another book;) but how he hath employed theſe in the day-time to the glory of the Giver, and the good of them amongſt whom he lives. This is a ſtrong argument to preſſe home this conſideration, even this, <hi>That the longeſt day will have his night.</hi>

                     <p>§ 1. Let that man, who hath ſpent the day in the may-game of the world, and, as the moſt do, who make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of time, nor think themſelves to be accountable for it, let him ask himſelf, what contentment he findes in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſo eagerly purſued all the day before; and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort they now give unto him, now that the night is come, and his doores ſhut upon him? He muſt needs anſwer that they are gone and paſſed; and moſt likely they have left but a ſad reliſh behinde. But yet if he be reſolved, when he is wakened, to tread the ſame wayes again of ſin and death, he muſt needs conſider withall, if he have the conſideration of a man, that, though now, through Gods gracious diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation towards him, the night is, and the morning will dawn; yet <hi>a night</hi> will come, which ſhall never have morning. A
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:204556:113"/> night, when our pleaſures, and profits, and honours, all that we call <hi>good things,</hi> and ſo dote upon, when all ſhall ſet and returne no more.</p>
                     <p>While we live here in this world; As the morning co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſo cometh the night; and as ſure as the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth day, ſo ſure ſorrow follows our pleaſures; which may teach us not to over-joy, or over-prize our worldly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when the candle of God ſhineth upon our taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, for they are ſhort and momentany, of ſmall continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: As ſure as the night cometh, ſo ſure a change will come. And here alſo when it is night, we know the day will dawn again, in its apponted time; <q>And though ſorrow may abide for a night, yet joy may come in the morning;</q> It is eaſie with Him to make it ſo, Who turneth <hi>the ſhadow of death into the morning</hi>

This preſent life is well called <hi>a vale of miſerie,</hi> for here are pains, perils, gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, &amp;c.

                     <p>Laſtly, when we lye down we are to be taught, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the mercies of the day, ſo to call to minde the dangers of the night. Houſes are marked out in the day-time, and broke open in the night; houſes alſo are fired in the night. And how helpleſſe is man, amidſt theſe caſualties and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers! If a ſleep, the theefe findes him bound to his hand; and if fire take his chamber, he is fewell for it; ſuch ſad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples we have known, &amp; our eyes have ſeene.

Naturally all things ſeeme black unto us in the night, and if we ſee no danger, nor ſee any reaſon of danger, yet our fancy can create dangers unto us.

As we cannot tell what a day may bring forth, ſo nor can we know, how our feares may increaſe before the next morning; we cannot (no not the wiſeſt of men) look forward a few houres, to tell what may happen before the day-dawn <note n="a" place="margin">

                        <q>The fault is in your ſelves, ye Noble-mens ſonnes, and therefore ye deſerve the greater blame, that commonly, the meaner mens children come to be the wiſeſt Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and greateſt doers, in the weightie affaires of the Realme.

                        <hi>plants</hi> are moſt neglected, and our <hi>Seminaries</hi> filled with the leſſe promiſing <hi>ſlipp's</hi> too ſoone ſet there, before they can ſuck any juyce or ſap; or too late, when they are firſt run out to <hi>ſeed</hi> and <hi>wilde</hi> in ſome other place. We ſee a great part of our Gentry, Citizens and others, running out very farre this way; ſo as they are like the ſluggards field, and by their cut and garb, they make their Parents feare, as much as that great <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſpake-out in his laſt teſtament, <q>That the childe will ſcatter as faſt as the Parent gathered, and emptie with as quick an hand, as the father did take in.</q> For the end anſwers the meanes; The childe was taught no obedience, when it might, now it is too old to learn: The childe was not bended when it was tender, now it is too ſtiffe, it will follow its own bent: The Parent hath ſlighted the <hi>grave counſell</hi> given him before <note n="i" place="margin">Chap. 1. p. 6. and chap. 2.</note> and neglected his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>ſeaſon</hi> and <hi>ſeed-time</hi> alſo; And now, that it is too late to call back yeſterday, he may thank himſelf for the evill conſequences from that neglect, and humble himſelf to ſmart patiently, for ſmart he muſt, if he have any feeling of the weight of his charge, or of his childes miſcarriage. He had his childe in his hand, and he might have carried him on fairely, and have taught him to know God, himſelf, and his parents; But the parent neglects this faire opportunitie, till the childe be ſlipt out of his parents hands, and from under his own alſo, whereto, he was at firſt, too ſoon and ill truſted; And then what follows, we ſee; and how the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and childe complaines, we have heard. <note place="margin">Pag. 18. &amp; 24.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This neglect is manifeſt; ſo is the hurt which iſſueth there-from. The ground or bottom of this neglect is as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, which is this, as appeares by full diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>The largeneſſe of the childes patrimony, cauſeth a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe, or ſcantneſſe in its education. He is heire of all, no matter how the <hi>Georgicks</hi> are neglected: He ſhall have goods enough; for the goods of the minde the leaſt care; Learning will be but a burden, at the beſt but a needleſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; ſo it is accounted, and ſo it falls out commonly, that the eldeſt childe is bred in ſuch a way, as that he can be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:204556:119"/> of little uſe to himſelf, and of no uſe at all, to others amongſt whom he lives. If meanes fall ſhort, as commonly they do, ſhort enough to the younger brothers, then they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to a trade, and then writing and cyphering fits them for the beſt, whether in citie or town. If there be a third brother, and he the loweſt, and weakeſt of all, then he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Preacher, as the Parents word is, he muſt be the Scholler: For the Parent hath a friend at Court, he is ſure in his purſe (as the wittie Knight ſaid) he knows a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and road-way for his preferment. My words here may be credited, for I beleeve my own eares; it is ordinary with Parents, thus to ſay, and to deſigne their children, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time, one to the <hi>Innes</hi> of Court, the ſecond to a <hi>trade,</hi> the third to the <hi>Pulpit</hi> (as we heard;) and accordingly the <note place="margin">Preface, pag. 26.</note> Parent will, and the Maſter ſhall, order them: while yet we may well diſcern, that the Parent diſcovers his own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not his childrens fitneſſe; rather what he is reſolved and will do, then what the children can do.</p>
                     <p>For the helping of this great deceit, and taking off this vaile of falſe opinion, I would adviſe the parent to fix on two concluſions, and accordingly to order his childe; firſt this;</p>
                     <p>That learning is the principall; riches, but an acceſſary: Learning makes the man; it fits him, and inables him both to ſerve himſelf and others; whereas without it, a man is commonly but a ſlave to himſelf, and a burden to others; The ſecond is,</p>
                     <p>That the parents duty is, and his endeavour muſt be with all his power, to give the childe inſtructions univerſally good and profitable, whereby the childe may be capable and ready to whatſoever. <hi>This is</hi> (ſaith Charron) <hi>to go upon a ſure ground, and to do that, which muſt alwayes be done;</hi> and may be done before their yeares will admit their deſignation to any courſe for afterwards. Accordingly now the parent muſt order the childe, firſt in the fit choice of a <hi>ſchool;</hi> then, when the <hi>ſchool</hi> hath ſufficiently promoted the childe, in the fit choice of a <hi>calling;</hi> touching both theſe, and firſt of the ſchool.</p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:204556:119"/>
                     <p> There muſt be a good foundation and ground-work lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the parents houſe: The parent muſt leade on the childe, as farre as the light and underſtanding he hath, can carry him. But we ſuppoſe a parent cannot do all, he muſt take the help of a <hi>maſter;</hi> but whether is moſt convenient, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his own walls, or without, admits ſome diſpute, which is not proper to this place. Experience, the oracle of time, concludes, that without the parents houſe is the fitteſt <note n="k" place="margin">

Therefore the parents care and foreſight at this point is more eſpecially required; and no more but what he will take in putting forth his cloth to making; he puts it forth to ſuch an one who can make it ſo, as that it ſhall give a gracefull comelineſſe to the body, and commend the workman. So carefull a man is in putting forth his cloth, not ſo in putting forth his childe, though, as was ſaid, both put forth <hi>to making:</hi> daily experience tells us ſo much; and the little good the childe hath found now after ſix yeers ſchooling, either for the informing his underſtanding, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his manners; The little in both, which the childe gained, ſpeaks it out plainly, that a wiſe choice was not made: And if the parent could underſtand the language, he ſhould then heare, that his loſſe hereby were more, and the injurie greater, then the thief had done him, who hath taken
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:204556:120"/> away his purſe, or broken his houſe. Therefore let a parent ſhew his diſcretion in the choice of him, to whom he will commit his childe; for he muſt remember, that he puts the childe out to making as he doth his cloth; and he cannot but remember alſo, that there holds little proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his childe and his cloth, though he would have them both made, and then certainly he will chooſe a workman for both.</p>
                     <p>And now that I think of this; that when a childe is put to a maſter, he is put out to <hi>making,</hi> for ſo much we muſt needs grant: And when I think again what a treaſure a childe is, and what a charge comes along with it; and then again what a faire opportunitie the maſter hath in his little nurce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or ſeminary to prune and manure this little plant, ſo as it may grow fruitfull, that the Church, and State, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that all may rejoyce together; when I conſider the opportunitie the maſter hath, even to his hearts deſire; ſo farre exceeding the opportunitie which the <hi>Paſtor</hi> hath, (at leaſt doth take) as that he hath not a day for a week, nor ſcarce an houre for his day, nor hath he the opportunitie to call his diſciples to an account: When I conſider this, I ſhrink at the thought of this charge, for I muſt needs think, that a maſters charge is very weighty, and that his neglect muſt be very much, if he do not very much good.</p>
                     <p>So much touching the choice of a ſchool-maſter, and the weight of his charge; if he be anſwerable unto it, the uſe the Church hath of him, is much more then is ordinarily conceived, and the ſervice he doth, greater then he is by the moſt accounted for, but he ſerveth a <hi>good maſter,</hi> The <hi>God of recompences,</hi> Whoſe paiment is ſure. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith the Father <note n="r" place="margin">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:204556:121"/> to the greatneſſe of their ſervice, a great reward. For the place of paiment, it is not ſet down, whether here or hereafter, that muſt be left to the wiſdome of our <hi>great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> but the paiment is certain and anſwerable to the honour of the work.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much alſo briefly to the dignitie of this work. As briefly now touching the method or way of performing the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The way the Maſter muſt take with his Scholler (I ſhall but point at it again) is clean contrary to the common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, which is the tasking the memorie in the firſt place. But I will not repeat what was before ſpoken <hi rend="sup">ſ</hi>; theſe two <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Preface p.</hi> 8. <hi>Book. p.</hi> 97. <hi>&amp;</hi> 98.</note> things I will addde,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Maſter muſt make the Mother-tongue, I mean that, wherein the childe is daily verſed and underſtands, a precognition to that tongue he underſtands not; it is the onely ready means to informe a childes underſtanding in both, and to ſpeed his courſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Maſter muſt make great uſe of the childes ſenſes; but ſo he doth not do, unles he makes the ſame uſe of examples. It is moſt certain, that a childe underſtands more by one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if in all mildneſſe he be taught how the example containes the rule, and concludes it, then by ſaying the rule twentie times over. The rule is too generall; But the eye can fix upon the example, and ſo fixeth the underſtanding; and then the underſtanding is a leading-hand to memory; now the childe goes on, with eaſe and delight. It is an old ſaying, but the truth thereof is more ancient; <q>That by precepts the way is long, but by examples we make a ſhort cut, and very compendious.</q> This is the principall thing to be noted and practiſed, in the promoting the childe; provided ſtill, we do not caſt-off the dull Boy, for he may, prove a ſolid and underſtanding Man. The childe ſeemes the <hi>duller,</hi> the <hi>quicker</hi> the Maſter is, and becauſe he leades on the childe in a <hi>dull</hi> way. Our proceeding at this point is very prepoſterous; and indeed <hi>Lilly</hi> hath led the way, and we follow him hood-winkt, as if we would not ſee more
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:204556:121"/> (low ſtatured-men though we are) then he did an hundred yeares ago, and more, and ſtanding ever ſince, as it were, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his and others ſhoulders. He begins with <hi>compoſition</hi> firſt, whereas he ſhould have begun with <hi>ſimple tearmes,</hi> as all know, who are acquainted with Art or reaſon. Your Maſter-builder, from whoſe Art we borrow our word of Art, knows that very well, for he fits his Stone and Timber firſt, then raiſeth the building; and when the firſt work is done, he counts all is done. Nature proceeds orderly without <hi>skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> or <hi>leaping</hi> 
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Naturanon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit ſaltum.</note>: ſo muſt <hi>Art</hi> too, and ſo muſt we alſo: For, if we would build like good work-men, we muſt fit our materialls firſt, ſimple words I mean, before we joyn them. And when we have done ſo according to the rule of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar and Art (for it takes all along with it) The childe is as fit for <hi>Aeſop, Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Ovid,</hi> as for the Childiſh book: Yet <note place="margin">Pueril.</note> ſuch our cuſtomes are, and ſo we fit our books, this part of <hi>Ovid</hi> for this <hi>form,</hi> that part for another; <hi>Virgil</hi> to the fourth; and <hi>Horace</hi> to the fifth, ſo making the formes more, and our labours too, but the benefit the leſſe.</p>
                     <p>All books are alike to the Engliſh and Latine Scholler, when once the grounds are well laid in letters and ſyllables for the Engliſh tongue, and in declenſion and verb for the Latine; though yet there muſt be great choice of the matter, ſuch ever, as is beſt <hi>ſutable,</hi> which will be ever that, which is moſt <hi>ſenſuall.</hi> But the main thing is, and which gives ſtrength to the building, what foundation is laid in declenſion and verb. And it is ſtrange that we do ſo much fail at this point, and are ſo much out of the way, becauſe our way herein hath been pointed out unto us by one, who was a famous Grammarian more then fifteen hundred yeares ſince <note n="u" place="margin">

                     <p>That the chiefeſt help for the ſpeeding the childe in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:204556:122"/> attaining to the tongues, and the moulding the ſpeech there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is not yet by any of our men, made known to our Countrey. I know well what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Aſcham</hi> hath done; A man of an approved judgement, and his work, of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt uſe of any we have printed in our tongue. I know as well what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Brimſely</hi> hath written, and the cleareneſſe of his intent therein. Our Grammar, (the beſt and eaſieſt of any for a learner) hath been viewed and reviewed; but it hath happened to that, as to the picture, which we reade <note n="x" place="margin">
                           <hi>Plin Nat. Hiſt</hi> 35. 10.</note>, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to publick cenſure. Something hath been added to it; letters I mean, which hindred the underſtanding very much, leading the childe in that common Rode-way, which no wiſe Maſter will ſuffer the childe to go in. This I am ſure of; That the Grammar was eaſier, and plainer, and better for the learner, twenty yeares ago and ten, then now it is, after all this reviſing; how it may prove, when it comes forth again, (for it is in hand now) we may ſhortly ſee. And when we ſee it, this we ſhall ſee by it, that, though the faults in the firſt inventers (to whom we ow moſt) are in good part corrected, and the rules of Etym. &amp;c. are brought into bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order (for after thoughts are more digeſted) yet can it help little the tediouſneſſe of our common courſe, nor much promote a ſpeedier and quicker way. Theſe helps before mentioned (if we may call them ſo, becauſe ſo intended) are above and in ſight, other things of more ſubſtance lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hatch and cannot appeare.</p>
                     <p>Here at this point, I muſt make mention of two, the one <note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Brook.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:204556:122"/> they are; for the common care is no bodies in particular; we traverſed this way, and that, and the other; all three wayes, but found no way, for relief of the Mother and her <hi>orphanes,</hi> ſo they are reſigned unto His hand, who makes a way in the <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi> and will be ſeen in the <hi>Mount,</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a lamb for a ſacrifice; He will provide alſo, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch a Father ſo carefull, ſo faithfull, ſhall not periſh for want of bread, nor periſh yet worſe for want of breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But I recall my ſelf remembring what I was ſpeaking, this, That had this perſon before mentioned found incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and help (for it is a work too hard for one or two) he had then very much promoted the publick good, for he had ſet out the cleareſt <hi>light to Grammar,</hi> for the clearing and ſpeeding the childes underſtanding and way therein, that ever yet our Church hath ſeen. And in good forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this work was ſet by him (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Horne)</hi> who was more then an eye and hand to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Brookes</hi> therein;) but, there being little hope then and leſſe now, that there can be a hand, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> can <hi>widwife-forth</hi> that birth, if it ſhould be perfected and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; therefore it was but coldly proceeded in then, and is like to lie now as a thing not thought upon, or forgotten. And therefore the forementioned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Horne</hi> hath taken the beſt and ſafeſt courſe, and but according to the advice of his Elders; he hath laboured for himſelf, and is ſetting forth a work of his own, whereby he leades on the childe to <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> &amp; <hi>Oratorie (Grammar</hi> is touched upon too in paſſage) in a clearer way then any man yet hath gone before him in.

And a fulneſſe this man hath, if the skill in the languages and arts may be accounted ſo; and, which is the crown of all, he hath an heart to lay forth his treaſure and to ſpend himſelf for the common good. And that is the way to encreaſe even to a fulneſſe; to empty our ſelves continually for the publick good, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> writes very uſefully.</p>
                     <p>I have ſpoken this, at this point, in a zeal I have to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:204556:123"/> the childes good, my ſubject now; and he, who gives another his due, doth not in ſo doing, detract from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I know there are many able and faithfull <hi>Miniſters</hi> this way, and the Lord encreaſe the number of them: But I conſider, Schollers muſt be wound-up within the ſame common winding ſheet, and laid to the ſame mould; In that very day, though their works follow them, for their labour cannot be in vain in the Lord, yet their thoughts pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. It is good to know them, and to uſe them while we have them.</p>
                     <p>Thus farre, touching the way the Maſter muſt go, and ſuch helps, which ſerve very much to promote the Scholler in the ſame way. The Maſters duty follows; and that is, to do his work throughly and fully in point of reformation, and information before the childe paſſe from under his hand: And Parents muſt have patience and ſuffer both to be done, before the childe be other-where diſpoſed of. It proves no ſmall diſadvantage to the childe and Church, that he is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to an higher <hi>Forme</hi> or place while his minde is empty and unfurniſht of ſuch matter, whereof, before he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſhould be well furniſhed: or that he is poſted into a ſtrange <hi>countrey</hi> to learn the language, before he hath learnt his Religion, or attained any ſtayed or fixed carriage, or command over himſelf. The ſucceſſe muſt needs be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for the childe is then moſt left to himſelf, when he is leaſt himſelf; when he is in the moſt ſlipperie <hi>age,</hi> and <hi>place</hi>

Therefore till the childe hath ſome good underſtanding of himſelf, and book; till he can command the one, and well uſe the other, what ſhould he do abroad, either at the Vniverſitie, Innes of Court, or in a farre Countrey? We can neither teach nor learn how to weigh, meaſure, or point the winde, as the Noble Advancer ſpeaketh, againſt the ſending of children abroad too ſoon and too unripe. Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie will not down nor <hi>Logick</hi> neither, and <hi>Littleton</hi> worſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:204556:123"/> then either of the former. They that go too unripe to thoſe places, quickly grow rotten. In all probabilitie, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily conceive otherwiſe, youth will leave that they underſtand not, and can finde no ſweetneſſe in; And they will to that, which they can do, and their natures muſt needs reliſh; They will to ſuch companions (their books they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not) whoſe language they can skill off; and when they cannot draw at the fountain, they will to the ſinke in thoſe places; and you may ſent them as ſtrongly, that there they have been, as if they had fell into a <hi>veſſell</hi> wherein is no pleaſure. There is great cauſe, we ſhould labour to ſet our children as upright as we can, and to fix their carriage before we ſend them forth from us, elſe there is great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of miſcarrying, conſidering what our natures are, as was ſaid <note n="z" place="margin">Pag. 44.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The ſumme then touching this point is, That there be a Graduat proceeding with the childe, as up a paire of ſtaires; That the childes ſeed-time be improved to the utmoſt.

                     <p>So much of <hi>callings,</hi> and how, in the proper uſe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of them, they help to ſodder and cement men together.</p>
                     <p>Now, becauſe there are <hi>callings</hi> miſcalled, callings, but are not ſo; ſerving only in the nature thereof, and not by accident, to enlarge the bounds of Satans kingdome: becauſe, I ſay, ſuch callings there are falſely ſo called, I will adde a word, touching the choice of callings, and make ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, touching the lawfulneſſe of the ſame, and how we know them ſo to be; for the lawfulneſſe of a calling gives the minde a ſettledneſſe, and ſure ground for comfort.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, I would not chooſe ſuch a <hi>calling,</hi> which hath more dependance upon the humours of men, then upon their neceſſities: which is taken up, or laid down, according as <hi>fancy</hi> leadeth, not as right reaſon guideth: ſuch callings there are, I may not ſay, unlawfull, but I would not chooſe ſuch a <hi>calling,</hi> ſo I ſay. Nor ſuch a calling would I chooſe, which, without more ſpeciall care and fore-ſight, will be quickly perverted from its own primitive nature, and firſt inſtitution, to ſupply the inſtruments of <hi>luxury, exceſſe, pride, vanitie;</hi> ſuch callings there are alſo, and very lawfull they are, and ſome there have been and now are, who uſe them <hi>lawfully:</hi> And they who do contrary, do not therefore make the callings unlawfull. But yet I only ſay, I would not chooſe ſuch a <hi>calling</hi> for my childe; conſidering the ready bent of our natures, how hardly we ſtand firme on firme
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:204556:127"/> ground. What danger then of falling, where, by occaſion of our callings, we ſtand ſurrounded with ſnares, and, as it were, on a <hi>precipice?</hi> ſuch a calling, I would not make choice of.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the lawfulneſſe of a Calling, and how we may know it ſo to be, it will be of uſe firſt to recall what was ſpoken before; and thence then to conſider what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence my <hi>calling</hi> hath into the good of the <hi>univerſe,</hi> and how farre, as a <hi>member,</hi> I promote there by the good and welfare of the body: for this ſaying of the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> in this caſe, is of univerſall truth and uſe; <hi>That which is not good for the Bee hive, or whole</hi> ſwarm, <hi>cannot be good for the Bee</hi>

                     <p>2. We may give more then a conjecture, what calling is lawfull, what unlawfull, by that, which was anciently ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a man of a very baſe life, and calling; <hi>I am</hi> ſaid he, <hi>by profeſſion ſuch an one,</hi>

                        <hi>whom good men would cruſh, quite ſtarve and ſhrink up: but wicked men put life in me, they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and keep me in heart.</hi> Hereby we may take a certain ſcale, what callings will hold weight, and what are to be diſallowed, and to be caſt out as <hi>refuſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. We may ſuſpect that for no <hi>calling,</hi> which cannot ſhew its <hi>deſcent,</hi> or <hi>pedigree</hi> in a ſtraight line from the firſt man downwards, on whom was laid (and ſo upon all our fleſh) This burden, <hi>In the ſweat of thy brows thou ſhalt eat thy bread;</hi> That is; in the travel and labour of thy body, or minde: And here the idle Gentle-man with his attendants, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded, as thoſe, who live in no calling, he and his man are leſſe ſerviceable to the place where they live, then is old lumber in an houſe, as was ſaid <note n="q" place="margin">
                           <hi>Book. pag.</hi> 44.</note>; Greatneſſe in place or eſtate gives no warrant for idleneſſe, though it doth give al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for ſuch an attendance, or retinue, as is ſutable to both; but yet ſo, as every one muſt have his office, and do his work belonging thereunto. If it was the praiſe of the vertuous woman, That ſhe did not <hi>eat the bread of idleneſſe</hi> 
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Prov. 31. 27.</note>; It muſt follow, that it is a diſhonour to the <hi>man,</hi> ſo to do. And if ſhe muſt look to <hi>the wayes of her houſhold,</hi> then ſo muſt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:204556:127"/> he alſo, elſe he walks inordinately, and without his rule. Every one that is grown-up to fitting yeares (he that is not, his calling is to fit himſelf for his calling) muſt <hi>work</hi> the thing which is good, with his hands and with his minde; elſe he is like a member in the body, out of its place, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſervice thereunto, but a diſſervice rather, cauſing a diſgrace, like ſome exuberance in the body.</p>
                     <p>4. Laſtly we may ſuſpect that calling, that hath not its allowance and legitimation in Gods word. Not, that every lawfull calling is named there, for we cannot quickly give a name to every lawfull calling; But that it hath its dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and originall grant from thence. If then I finde no warrant there, for the lawfulneſſe of my calling, I am ſure to fall ſhort of comfort in it. I may encreaſe my meanes by it, but certainly I ſhall not encreaſe my joy.</p>

                     <p>This is a main point, and I touch upon it here, becauſe many there are, who, ſerving their particular callings, and doing their duties there, think, that this will hold them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, for their neglect in their generall calling, as they are Chriſtians.

                     <p>
                        <q>This perverſe judgement of fathers, as concerning the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unfitneſſe of their <hi>children,</hi> cauſeth the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth have many unfit Miniſters:</q>

                        <hi>nor nothing elſe, which is not very fit for him: The Common-wealth can be content to take at a fond fathers hand, the riffe raffe of the world, to make thoſe inſtruments of, wherewithall ſhe ſhould work the higheſt matters under Heaven. And ſurely an Aule of Lead is not ſo unprofitable in a Shoo-makers ſhop, as an unfit Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, made of groſſe metall, is unſeemely in the Common-wealth. Fathers in old Time, among the noble Perſians, might not do with their children as they thought good, but as the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Common-wealth alwayes thought beſt. This fault of fathers bringeth many a blot with it, to the great deformitie of the Common wealth: and here ſurely I can praiſe Gentle-women, which have alwayes at hand their glaſſes, to ſee if any thing be amiſſe, and ſo will amend it, yet the Common-wealth, having the glaſſe of knowledge in every mans hand, doth ſee ſuch uncomeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it, and yet winketh at it. This fault and many ſuch like, might be ſoone wiped away, if fathers would beſtow their children on that thing alwayes, whereunto nature hath ordained them moſt apt and fit. For if youth be grafted ſtreight, and not awry, the whole Common-wealth will flouriſh thereafter.</hi> So the Author goes on very uſefully, and that, which we reade in the ſide of the leafe before, is as notable, but I omit it, and returne now where I brake of; The Leſſon then is.</p>
                     <p>Parents muſt firſt diſcerne their childrens fitneſſe before they deſigne them to any calling: And they muſt diſcerne Gods good hand pointing them, and fitting their childe more peculiarly for that great work (they ſpeake ſo ſlightly of) before they muſt have thoughts to deſigne them thereunto, or any other way; whereof as follows.</p>
                     <p>As there is a great varietie of callings; ſo is there a great varietie of diſpoſitions diverſly inclined thereunto. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think any childe equally inclined to this and that all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. There is a ſpeciall <hi>bent</hi> and <hi>byas</hi> of nature, and thence a fitneſſe and more peculiar aptneſſe to this rather then to that in the moſt children. A proprietie very hard to finde out; Therefore we muſt follow <hi>nature</hi>

De Aug.</hi> 6. 10.</note> as cloſe as we can, and uſe all the helps this way to make diſcovery of the childes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, which, being well underſtood, brings in a very
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:204556:131"/> pretious commodity. The childe diſcovers himſelf beſt, when he thinks the Parent obſerves him leaſt. The more careleſſe the parents eye ſeems to be (it ſhould never be careleſſe, though ſometimes ſee mingly ſo) the more ſerious the childe is, and the more diſcovers his inclination. Or, if the childe be more reſerved (as it is cunning enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it ſelf and others too, in that which moſt concerneth its good) then note the childe well in the kitchin, I mean, in ſuch a place, he ſuſpects not his Parents eare or eye, then he may be underſtood. Therefore there is great need, that ſome wall ſhould have an eare, and ſome open place a ſpiall: as much need there is of ſome truſty ſervants, with whom the childe will be open and plain, for if he or her be faithfull to God and the Parent, they may do, and in nothing more, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and faithfull ſervice this way.</p>
                     <p>The Cautions here are theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Parents do not give too much heed and credit to the light divinations and conjectures they take from the motions of childehood or youth, which are as unſtable and uncertain as the water, and may deceive the Parent exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and commonly do.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nor muſt the Parent credit what children ſay; they are very ſubtil to hurt themſelves, and very cunning for their own ends (Nature teacheth them.) A childe will ever ſeem to bend to this or that, ſo farre as he, in his fore-ſight, which is none, may think it makes for his eaſe and libertie, which he thinks a change may bring (as the aſſe in the fable;) and if he may, to the <hi>writing-ſchool,</hi> then he is ſure of it; the Latine ſchool is too cloſe for him; he is, for his good, too much pent up there. Here we may obſerve how the childe will turn and winde himſelf in-to the Parent. The childe will make the Parent beleeve, that he can no way skill of the book, but of any courſe elſe very well, what the Parent will, for that way his ingenie doth <hi>bias</hi> him: ſo the childe will ſay, and ſo the Parent beleeves him; whereas his <hi>bent</hi> is onely that way, which he thinks may give him more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, ſcope and elbow-room in the world. Therefore the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:204556:131"/> Parent muſt be as wiſe as a ſerpent, for the childe is not ſo innocent as a dove: It is the very maſter-piece of a childes <hi>cunning</hi> to deceive and hurt it ſelf. A Parent then muſt not hearken to the childe, but to his own diſcerning of the childes parts, and accordingly he muſt fit him with generall inſtructions, making him as capable as he may, and ready <hi>girt</hi> for any courſe.</p>
                     <p>But for the deſigning the childe to this or that <hi>calling,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a clearer inſight unto the childes inclination and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that way, then the Parent can attain unto by his own ſtrength: and therefore the Parents work in this caſe is more ſpecially and peculiarly with God. He looks up to that Hand, which wiſely ordereth all things, and which is never looked up unto <hi>in vain.</hi> He remembers, that the Lord Chriſt prayed all the night before He choſe His Diſciples; which teacheth man what to do in matters of weight and difficultie; even to wait upon a ſecret and inviſible Hand, which way that points and directeth. And if the Parent do look up earneſtly to This Hand (which cannot be in vain) it will eaſily be diſcerned thus.</p>
                     <p>That Parent, whoſe eye is to God, carrieth the ſame ſingle towards His glory. He thinks not what advantage may come, what preferment may be had; he thinks not thereon, as on a <hi>Principall:</hi> But how the childe may receive moſt good, (he means that, which is good indeed) how he may do moſt ſervice, moſt promote Gods glory. This is the very life of the Parents life, and it muſt be the very ſoul of his actions; it was the end, wherefore God gave them the childe, and for that end they muſt return the childe back again. So the Parent aimes at, and deſires the beſt and moſt excellent way, but he looks to the childes fitneſſe that way; he will proportion his childes place, to the portion of his childes gifts, that the childe may not ſtretch <note n="k" place="margin">

So it might have ſtaied a longer Time, but I knew not how ſhort my Time might be, and I made all ſpeed, when I was upon it, to leave ſuch inſtructions as might be of uſe to them,
<pb facs="tcp:204556:135"/> when I could not, and to make them Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. They ſhould have been more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, for ſo I intended at the firſt, but a ſheete or two, and ſo, to have ſpoken much in a Little; but ſo I could not doe, nor was it proper if I could; for then it had been of little uſe to thoſe, unto whoſe hands it is more ſpecially commended.</p>
                  <p>It had gone forth alone, without a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Part, if ſo it could have been thought entyre; But ſo it was not thought. It was <hi>ſpecially</hi> intended, but the uſe of generall concernment, not ſo particularly any ones, but that it doth concerne every one, that will reade it. It leads on a Childe through all the Stages of his life (which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied here, ſupplied in the Firſt Part,) and through the great occurrences, we meete with therein; And, for our clearer paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through them all, It ſupplieth ſuch <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which I may call, as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Strong meat,</hi> becauſe none but a <hi>Man-Childe</hi> can digeſt them.</p>
                  <p>It ſuppoſeth a <hi>Daughter</hi> rather, as there was reaſon, and ſo goeth on in that <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:204556:135"/> and in ſtrict proprietie of ſpeech for matter and forme both, for (both) were to be obſerved for Gender-ſake; but yet, whether ſonne or daughter, it reſpecteth both alike, for its Scope and <hi>white</hi> is, To improove the <hi>ſoule,</hi> which hath no Sex.</p>
                  <p>The margent is ſometimes (yet as ſparingly as might be) charged with a <hi>Barbarous</hi> Language: (ſuch is that to you and me, which wee underſtand not <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 11.</note>) One reaſon was, That it might both pleaſe and profit more then one; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That the line might be kept free, and not a word there to hinder the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; for I conſidered ſtill all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, <hi>whom I would teach to profit,</hi> and therefore if there be any word in the line not ſo familiar in our Language, it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a ſecond to explaine it. I have often thought of the Apoſtles words, and very obſervable they are. <q>If ye ſpeake with Tongues to the unlearned, will they not ſay, ye are mad <note n="b" place="margin">verſ. 23.</note>?</q> Truely I affect not words, but matter; and ſuch words too, if my heart deceive me not, which may yeeld the moſt profit.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:204556:136"/>
                  <p> That I have Intituled this yours, there was a kinde of inforcement, which hath not alwaies good reaſon to ſtrengthen it, but yet, as it falls out, I have reaſon too. Things of this nature are not thought comely nor well addreſſed to goe abroad, unleſſe they carrie ſome perſons In <hi>front,</hi> to whom they are ſpecially Devoted, ſo here I was inforced.</p>
                  <p>And that I made choice of the <hi>Mother,</hi> and the <hi>Daughter,</hi> I had reaſon for that, which ye ſhall heare, and, how reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it is, of that ye ſhall judge.</p>
                  <p>We make choice of ſuch perſons, to whom our perſonall relations are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: In this then, I am ſure, I am right, and have right good reaſon.</p>
                  <p>And of thoſe alſo, whom we moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. I am right here too, and by the ſame reaſon, for there are no two in the world (for theſe perſonall and particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, ſo I muſt be underſtood) whom I more honour then your ſelves; or, who have more deſerved honour, in your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and particular waies, then your ſelves have, from all that know you. And this
<pb facs="tcp:204556:136"/> I ſpeake clearely without the leaſt ſhew of flatterie, which I hate, as I doe that, my ſtomack moſt loatheth.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all this, there are vertues point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at here, which claime acquaintance with you, and ſay, ye have an intereſt in them, for they are yours. When I come to the Middle-Age, you ſhall finde the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Adviſing about a match for the Childe, and ſo on, where ye ſhall reade theſe particulars pointed at (for though I am verie long in the whole, I am ſhort in the parts, pointing at things in paſſage briefly, So giving the Reader an hint for further inlargement) pointed at, I ſay, a <hi>diſcreet</hi> Parent; a <hi>vertuous</hi> Wife; a <hi>grave</hi> Matron, an <hi>honourable</hi> Age. And, in the ſhutting up of the book, a cloſing of the eie; yeelding up all into the hands of Death, which yet is to ſuch, as <hi>Ioſephs wagons,</hi> ſerving onely to convey thoſe, who are ſuch, To the place of reſt, where they would be. And ſuch ye are, I think, and an intereſt ye have in thoſe vertues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, ye may lay claime to them, and call them yours, elſe I know
<pb facs="tcp:204556:137"/> not where to finde a <hi>vertuous</hi> woman, a <hi>True</hi> wife, a <hi>grave</hi> Matron, an <hi>honourable</hi> Age. Therefore I conclude, ſuch ye are; And that your departure out of this life will be joyfull, for ye go to the God, <hi>whoſe ye are,</hi> and whom <hi>you ſerve</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 27. 23.</note>, the ſtrongeſt ground for comfort that ye can ſtand on.</p>
                  <p>And now that I have concluded ſo, I have excluded none from partaking with you in the ſame vertues, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and wiſh that all were even ſo, and <hi>more abundant.</hi> So it puts you on to <hi>ſtrive,</hi> to <hi>improve,</hi> to <hi>grow,</hi> to <hi>increaſe.</hi> It is the Apoſtles inocuragement often, none more often, and to thoſe, who had gone verie farre, even to <hi>perfection;</hi> where note our perfection here, is our ſtrife after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

                     <p>It is an argument that we feare as we ought before the God of Heaven, when we forbear the doing of that, which, if we ſhould do, it were not poſſible that man ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand or condemne it; as <note n="h" place="margin">Lev. 19. 14.</note> is the <hi>curſing of the deafe,</hi> which

                        <p>§. 1. I meane not that privy pride, ſpringing up from a ſecret and unſuſpected fountaine; even from an holy zeale, godly duties, good actions, not properly ours, yet fleſh and bloud will lay claime unto them; And hath its ſeat in a ſanctified ſoule, making it proud, that it is not proud, even of its <hi>humilitie.</hi> And therefore doth the ſame ſoule make its watch the ſtronger.</p>
                        <p>I meane that <hi>pride,</hi> whoſe root is diſcernable; and whoſe fruit ſooneſt ſhooteth forth and declareth it ſelfe, defiling our <hi>outward</hi> members and <hi>inward</hi> faculties; lifting us up ſo much the higher in a windy conceit; the emptier and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we are upon the ballance, and the more <hi>wanting.</hi> And this, ſome call the Womans ſinne.

But yet, <q>Sith there is (as one no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note n="c" place="margin">

For, if we do grant, as ordinarily it ſeemes ſo, and is ſo concluded; That the inward powers of Iudgement, and Reaſon, are weaker in women, then in men; we muſt needs grant, That <hi>pride,</hi> as it is (till of late) more ordinarily diſcovered in that <hi>ſex,</hi> then in the other; ſo it is, for the ſame reaſon, more incident unto them. They may have leſſe <hi>inward</hi> worth, and beautie to commend them, and therefore do they the more paint, and adorne the <hi>outward.</hi> Likely it is, that they do not ſo well diſcerne the <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>naked truth</hi> of things, and therefore delight themſelves in <hi>feathers, toyes, flattering conceits, falſe valuations.</hi>

                        <p>They are not ſo well able to ſtudy nature, as men may and can, therefore may they (it is not proper to ſay they may, and yet more excuſeable it is in them, then in men) they may pleaſe themſelves with poliſhed Art (at the beſt but natures Ape,) rather then with that, which is ſimple and naturall; with very <hi>app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Laſtly, they may not be ſo able, to ſtudy themſelves; The <hi>principles</hi> they conſiſt of; The <hi>foundation</hi> they ſtand on; The vileneſſe of the <hi>body;</hi> The excellent <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>dignitie</hi> of the ſoul; The faculties of both <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoul;</hi> The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that <hi>end,</hi> for which they received them.

For from hence it is (and ſo we may go through all things that do lift up man and blow up that bubble) hence it is, That our <hi>clothes,</hi> made for neceſſity and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea to make us humble, and thankfull (humilitie and thankfulneſſe ſtill go together) do prove ſo contrary to thoſe ends, priding us up in our own conceits, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring us in the eyes of others.</p>
                        <p>Hence it is that we are ſuch Faſhioniſts: ſo phantaſtick and changeable that way, That the Taylor can as hardly fit us, as the <note n="d" place="margin">

                        <p>Hence it is, That our <hi>haire</hi> made to cover our <hi>ſcalp,</hi> doth in a windy humour to a baſe faſhion, cover our face, and that part of it, which of any ſhould not be covered: So that which was made for an ornament, (and we ſhould finde it ſo, if we wanted but an eye-brow) is ſo nouriſhed, and let to ſpread out ſo, that it makes the perſon look like <hi>afurie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence it is, that we do tread like the <hi>Antipodes</hi> (if the word were proper) clean contrary to nature, hiding that, which ſhould be covered, and covering that which ſhould be hid.</p>
                        <p>Hence it is, That our eyes, feet, fingers, our whole ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture

                        <p>Hence it is, That <hi>Knowledge</hi> doth puff up, That <hi>Learning</hi> makes proud: which is not Knowledge indeed nor Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but our ignorance and going back wards, a windie and flatuous conceit of both. True Learning the more it is, and the truer it is, the more it humbles, the cloſer it lies, the leſſe noiſe it makes.</p>
                        <p>Hence it is, That the rich mans wealth is his <note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 18. 11.</note>

                        <p>Hence it is, That men in eminency of gifts and place, are ſo taken up with the perſon, for a time put upon them; That they both in look, and ſpeech, and geſture ſhew, that they forget their naturall condition; That they muſt lay aſide their perſons and <hi>dye like men;</hi> and give account, as ſtewards, what they have gained.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, hence it is, That our owne Righteouſneſſe ſeemes ſo lovely in our eyes, when as it is but like filthy <hi>rags</hi> and <hi>dung,</hi> ſuch things we may not otherwiſe name, ſo filthy they are; And were it conſidered, it would help much to caſt <hi>a ſpewing upon our glory</hi>

                        <p>This letting in of this little, by the eye or eare, is like the letting in of a little thiefe by a little window, who opens the doore and gates, for the greater theeves to enter and to make ſpoyle.

                        <p>The chiefe leſſon then is this; As we deſire and expect to have communion with God, we muſt addreſſe our ſpirits before Him <hi rend="sup">p</hi>; we muſt be pure not in body only, but in heart alſo; nay we muſt be in our meaſure pure and holy as <hi>He</hi> is, if we look to ſee <hi>Him as He is.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We muſt conſider withall; That our unclean ſpirits, make us like that <hi>Spirit,</hi> who, though he commits no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall uncleanneſſe (ſome tell us of ſexes in divels, or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them, and of their filthineſſe that way <hi rend="sup">q</hi>) yet he is called an <hi>uncleane ſpirit;</hi> And as he is, he is called, which tells us, That the uncleanneſſe of our ſpirits and hearts, as it is the greateſt defilement, ſo it doth make us moſt like the divell. And therefore if this uncleane ſpirit, or our ſelves have ſtirred a <hi>ſinke</hi> in our ſoules, we muſt not ſtirre it more by our imagination, but, as we uſe to do, when a ſink is ſtirred, we go into a ſweeter roome; ſo we muſt remove
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:204556:185"/> our thoughts, and take off our imagination, from ſtirring and puddering in that filth. And this we may do, by finding it ſome ſweeter, more cleanly and befitting work. It is certain, that the imagination hath a power, if it be put forth (but that requires an other power) to raiſe it ſelfe as ſwiftly, and as quick (which is the excellency of it) to heaven, to the high and great things there, as it will deſcend to hell, though it be a naturall deſcent, to thoſe black things there: And it is certain too, that <hi>hopes on high,</hi> will lead to thoughts on high; The nobleneſſe of the ſoule, and thoughts thereof, and of great things prepared for it, will remember our imaginative ſacultie of noble work, of high and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie conſiderations.</p>
                        <p>If our affections be indeared to any ſenſuall delight, they will drown our fancies therein: and on the other ſide, our fancies, quicke and nimble though they be, yet will they move heavily, and die in their exceſſive motion to the things below, if the ſoule be taken up with the Love of the beſt things. And this leads me to the laſt thing, which is a more ſpeciall and ſoveraign vertue, to help and fortifie our ſoule againſt her ſenſuall appetites; I meane ſuch helps which reaſon can ſuggeſt. I know if the Eye of the Lord awe us; <note place="margin">Job 31.</note> if deſtruction from God be a terrour unto us; if the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of holineſſe comes into the heart, then the work is done.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In the laſt place then, becauſe our imagination hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and betrayeth our ſuccours within, by falſe repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and by preventing reaſon, uſurping a cenſure of things before our judgements try them; whereas, the office of imagination is, to miniſter matter to our underſtanding to work upon, not to lead it, much leſſe to miſ-lead it; ſith, I ſay, our caſe is ſo, and ſo depraved our facultie is; we muſt take great heed, and give all diligence, <q>That, (as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently adviſeth) we ſuffer not things to paſſe ſuddenly from the imagination to our will, and affection;</q> we muſt aske adviſe firſt of our judgement (That is the light, and eye of the inward man, and we muſt pray for the inward anoynting) whoſe office it is to weigh things in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance

                        <p>There is a ſickneſſe of fancy, and there is no way to cure it, but by adviſing with judgement.

                        <p>That perſon is ſeldome overcome of <hi>anger,</hi> who can take ſome command over himſelf in ſuch things, which yet, we may think, do little concern that paſſion; but yet they do very much. For the reaſon why a man hath ſo little rule over himſelf in a paſſion, is, becauſe he had ſo little comd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:204556:190"/> over himſelf, when he was out of his paſſion: or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſo ſhall I ſpeak more properly, becauſe he carryes himſelf, as one in a paſſion alwayes.</p>
                        <p>I have often thought on thoſe words of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi>

I have known ſome, who would not reach their hands to a diſh, or cup ſo ſoone as they might; they would abridge themſelves, and take of from that <hi>eagerneſſe</hi> of <hi>ſpirit,</hi> we are ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: So they could keep themſelves from coming under the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>creature,</hi> and more able, by uſing this fitting command over themſelves, to carry themſelves <hi>calmely,</hi> and <hi>temperately,</hi> in the <hi>puzell</hi> of buſineſſe, and <hi>tempeſt</hi> of humane life. He that carryes himſelfe as in a paſſion alwayes, we muſt looke to ſee him ſometimes in a phrenſie, when it would become him, to have moſt command over himſelfe. He that cannot temper himſelfe in lawfull things, will run ryot in unlawfull.</p>
                        <p>This is a point of ſpeciall conſideration; it takes of from niceneſſe and weakeneſſe of ſpirit, which ſharpneth very much the edge of anger <note n="b" place="margin">

As in proſperitie God mingles ſome croſſe to diet us; ſo in all croſſes there is ſomething to comfort us. As there is a vanitie lies hid in the beſt worldly good; ſo there is a bleſſing lies hid in the worſt worldly evil. God uſually makes up that with ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in another kinde, wherein we are inferiour to others. Others are in greater place, ſo they are in greater danger; others be richer, ſo their cares and ſnares be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: The poore in the world may be richer in faith then they. The ſoul can better digeſt and maſter a low eſtate then a proſperous, and being under ſome abaſement, it is in a leſſe diſtance from God. Others are not ſo afflicted as we, then they have leſſe experience of Gods gracious power then we. Others may have more healthy bodies, but ſouls leſſe weaned from the world. We would not change con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions with them, ſo as to have their ſpirits with their condition. For one half of our lives, the meaneſt are as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and free from cares, as the greateſt Monarch: that is, whileſt both ſleep, &amp; uſually the ſleep of the one is ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the ſleep of the other. What is all that the earth
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:204556:199"/> can afford us, if God deny health? and this a man in the meaneſt condition may enjoy. That wherein one man differs from another, is but <hi>title,</hi> and but for a little time; death levelleth all. There is ſcarce any man, but the good he receives from God, is more then the ill he feels, if our unthankfull hearts would ſuffer us to think ſo. Is not our health more then our ſickneſſe? do we not enjoy more then we want? I mean of the things that are neceſſary; are not our good dayes more then our evill? And yet (ſo unkindly we deale with God) one croſſe is more taken to heart, then an hundred bleſſings. We ſhould conſider, God doth not owe us any thing. Thoſe that deſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be content with any thing. We ſhould look to others as good as our ſelves (as well as to our ſelves) and then we ſhall ſee it is not our own caſe onely; who are we that we ſhould look for an exempt condition from thoſe troubles, which Gods deareſt children are addicted unto?</q>

                        <p>The chief help then of our diſcontent is, to look up to a ſupreame hand; The Heathen alſo by their glimmering light, could diſcerne how vaine it was to ſtrive againſt the <hi>abſolute prerogative</hi> thereof.

                     <p>The Sacrament of the Lords Supper; therein we ſee the <hi>Coſt</hi> of our Redemption, and the matter and ſubſtance of our Righteouſneſſe before God, which doth conſiſt, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, in His body broken upon the croſſe, and His bloud communicated unto us.

And all this (for the Sacrament in it ſelf is but a corruptible, and earthly creature; and an unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtrument to work ſuch admirable effects in man) all this reſteth upon the ſtrength of His glorious power, who bringeth to paſſe, that the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>cup,</hi> which He giveth, though true Bread and Wine (for our ſenſes tell us ſo, and in ſuch caſes they cannot be deceived) ſhall be truly the thing promiſed; the fleſh of Chriſt, which is meat indeed; and the bloud of Chriſt, which is drink indeed.</p>

The more ſowre our ſinnes, the more ſweet is Chriſt; The more loathing of them, as the alone and greateſt evill, the more prizing of Chriſt, as the only and greateſt good, the choiſeſt of ten thouſands.

                     <p>It is now with the penitent as once it was, and as ever it will be: A ſorrow to repentance is not a work of a day or two, the hanging down the head like a bulruſh for a day, or an houre, as the cuſtome is. Where there is a <hi>breaking</hi> the <hi>bands</hi> of our <hi>yoke,</hi> there is a <hi>making to go upright</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:204556:204"/> Lord createth and ſtrengthneth, to lay hold on eternall life by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>In the Sacrament of the Lords Supper we ſee a full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought, and a full price paid in His body bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and bloud poured forth.

But now, as the mouth is opened, ſo are we filled; As the heart is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, ſo do we receive. If the mouth be ſhut, and the principle of life be wanting, no matter what dainties are ſet before us, or what put in. Therefore we muſt conſider our Intereſt in the Covenant, and whether we can lay hold on a promiſe, for life, reconciliation, and peace: For the bloud of Chriſt and His Body ſerve not for the nouriſhment of any, in whom they have not been as the ſeed of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both in pardon of ſin, and change of the heart, in which converſion ſtandeth; we muſt remember, Sacraments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert none, but ſtrengthen the converted: To the fainting ſpirit, they are meanes to convey power, they <hi>encreaſe ſtrength</hi> 
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Iſa. 40. 29.</note>. The Sacraments are as the breaſts of the Church, from which the living childe doth <hi>ſuck,</hi> and is ſatisfied with <hi>conſolations;</hi> from which the thirſty ſoul doth <hi>milke out,</hi> and is delighted with the <hi>abundance of her glory</hi> 
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Iſa. 66.</note>: But it is the living childe that draweth comfort here, and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which he draweth, is <hi>Faith,</hi> which is Gods gift, as is Repentance; He gives both.</p>
                     <p>So then, we muſt examine how provided we come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, elſe we come to a well of living water, but having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to draw: or we are like a veſſell caſt into the Ocean, which hath no mouth, or, if any, it is ſtopt. The outward man can do its part; it diſcerneth, taſteth, digeſteth, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes; But now what inward principle hath my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and what help hath it from all this, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, taſting, enjoying the ſpirituall part, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>influence</hi> of His <hi>Grace</hi> iſſuing therefrom? This is all the Queſtion, and point to be examined; what Faith I have? whoſe work is the ſame, about the ſpirituall part, as is the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:204556:204"/> work of the outward man about the outward. And yet had we <hi>all Faith,</hi> I mean juſtifying faith, we could not receive all that is offered here: and though we have a weake faith, if true, we ſhall receive ſufficient. <hi>Our hearts (as one noteth) cannot comprehend all the wiſdome of God in the wind that blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We beleeve in the Lord our God, yet we know not what is his countenance; we beleeve and apprehend by hope, His glory; yet neither eye can ſee it, nor eare can heare it. We beleeve and ſee immortalitie, yet our heart cannot comprehend, the heighth, the breadth, the length, the depth. We beleeve the reſurrection of the dead, yet we cannot underſtand ſuch excellent wiſdome, how life is renewed in the disperſed and ſcattered bones and aſhes. We beleeve our Saviour Chriſt is man, and we have ſeen Him and felt Him; yet how He was man, born of a virgin, all men in the world have no wiſdome to declare. Even ſo we beleeve, that our Saviour Chriſt and we be one, He of us, and we of Him, He the head, we the body, really, ſubſtantially, truly joyned together; not by joynts and ſinewes, but by His ſpirit, of which we have all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; And this unitie I cannot conceive, nor utter, till I know God even as He is, and His holy ſpirit which hath wrought this bleſſing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet, though thus ſecret and undiſcernable this work of faith is; we may take ſome evidence of the life, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration thereof, by thoſe things, that our underſtanding part doth here, in matters below, and of another, and much inferiour nature;</p>
                     <p>As thus; My minde, by the velocitie and ſpeed of my apprehenſion, can be many miles off, upon the naming of the things I love: Then ſurely my heart is dull and ſlow, and wants the principle of a new creature, if, by ſo lively repreſentations of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt under theſe ſignes,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:204556:205"/> to nouriſh and cheere me; if I cannot Eagle-like flye up to heaven unto Him, and on that carcaſſe faſten and fixe my faith, thence to draw ſtrength and refreſhing. The ſoul can preſently be one with that, it delights in, be it profit, be it pleaſure; and it ſhould much convince and aſhame us of our flatneſſe herein, a matter of ſuch concernment; And in caſe we finde no ſuch working, then to withdraw our foot being <note place="margin">Tremenda myſteria.</note> now approaching towards thoſe high, and awfull myſteries: For, if our hearts can open towards the earth, and unite with things there, but are flat and heavy towards Heaven; no working that way where the Treaſure is, the Lord of Glory, then ſurely we are no fit gueſts for this table. For certain it is; That whenſoever our ſoul ſhall feele its union with God in Chriſt, all things below will ſeeme baſe unto it; the ſoul cannot unite with them, nor be ſervant unto them: uſe them ſhe may, but ſhe enjoyes God; her union there, parts, unrivets, and divorceth her from baſe unions and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhips with things below. And ſo much to the ſecond Grace required in the Receiver.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third is Love: Love to God, who loved us firſt; and gave His Sonne, that we might not periſh; Love to to Chriſt, who ſo dearely bought us; a Love as ſtrong as Death; which ſtirres up all the powers of the Body and Soul to love Him again; ſo as we can thinke nothing too much, or too hard to do or ſuffer for Him, who hath ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded towards us. The Hiſtory of His paſſion is more largely ſet down, then is the Hiſtory of His Nativitie, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, or Aſcenſion; and for this reaſon it is, That all the circumſtances thereof, are ſo largely ſet down, That our hearts ſhould be enlarged after Chriſt; That we ſhould have largeneſſe of affection to Him, and theſe <hi>ſteeped</hi> as it were in His bloud, and crucified to His croſſe, and buried in His grave. And as Love to Him, ſo love to our Brother for His ſake <note n="*" place="margin">Amicum in Chriſto, inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum propter Chriſtum.</note>.

                     <p>It remains onely, that I give ſome ſatisfaction to a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion or two; theſe they are.</p>

                     <p>A weighty Queſtion this, of high and univerſall concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For he or ſhe that eats and drinks <hi>unworthily,</hi> are guilty of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of the Lord <note n="o" place="margin">1.

                     <p>So then we muſt be well adviſed what we do; For if we ſpill mans bloud (as God forbid we ſhould, for bloud cries; yet if we would) we have another <hi>bloud</hi> to cry unto, which cries for mercy; but if we ſpill this Bloud, and tread it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, what then? whither then ſhall we flie for mercy, when, with our own hands, we have plucked down our <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary?</hi> We ſpill, we caſt away our right pretious <hi>medicine:</hi> We muſt then be well adviſed what we do; and be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled very low for what we have done; even to <hi>girding with ſackcloth;</hi> and <hi>wallowing in duſt.</hi>

                     <p>1. The proceeding herein of the younger folk, is like themſelves, raſh and headie; as if what they did to day, could be undone a moneth after; And ſo they pay for their raſhneſſe, and have time enough for repentance all their life after. How oft have I known two green heads, who could think of nothing but the preſent, give their conſents for the undoing of themſelves? But becauſe their conſent is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, without a fourth perſon (for we make no doubt but the maid or man-ſervant is the third perſon, alwayes a pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Servi corrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Parents quickly heare of it, and we may be ſure, it wounds deep; For now (as it is moſt likely in ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding) neither their ſorrow, nor their vvealth, nor their counſell can poſſibly redeeme their childe from perpetuall thraldome.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Miniſter,</hi> I call this man, who knit this couple, and made them one, and a <hi>miniſter</hi> he will be called; whether
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:204556:209"/> we will or no; be it ſo; but in my conſtruction, it is in a large ſenſe, ſo an <hi>hang-man</hi> is a <hi>miniſter</hi> alſo, and in this caſe, he doth but the office of a very <hi>executioner;</hi> yet, which doth more debaſe him, in a moſt unlegall way. And ſuch an one, I ſaw once ſtanding before an honourable Court, for joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by vertue of his much abuſed office, two perſons, in condition very unequall; and as unſeaſonably too, in the night; within leſſe then one houres time after the Father of him, now newly yoked, was departed out of this world; his <hi>orders</hi> (I think they are called ſo; and ſo called to put ſuch men in minde of their duty even to walk orderly) were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, and ſome other penalty inflicted upon his purſe, which he regarded not, for the ale houſe had dryed and ſhrunken up that before hand; and ſome reſtraint of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie (but he was a priſoner before:) For any further pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, it is not within the verge of that Courts juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Theſe points following are too high for me to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; whether the knot which this fellow hath knit, be of that ſtrength, as with us it is accounted? Some think not ſo, and have their grounds for ſo thinking; but if ſo, I mean, if being ſo unlawfully knit, it cannot be lawfully undone; then, whether our proviſion of laws in Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, are not too ſhort for the pulling out of theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers? Theſe be matters too high for me, but, I am ſure of theſe two things, which I ſpeak very feelingly, as one who knows the heart of a Parent;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That my childe is a much more valuable commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then is my purſe, my horſe or my <hi>mare.</hi> A childe is a fathers earthly treaſure, the other are trifles in compariſon, and being loſt, may be made up again. It is not ſo with a child; if a ruffian-like-hath ſtolen her affections, or her away, and another, alike perſon or Prieſt, hath married them, this loſſe is unreparable, the Parent cannot recover or make it up again. And what can recompence this loſſe? A childe is ſtolen away; ſhe is unequally yoaked for <hi>eternitie,</hi> for life I am ſure. The Parent now may complain ſadly and that is all, for help he cannot.</p>

This I know alſo, That, thoſe of that ſacred <hi>order</hi> (for ſo their <hi>orders</hi> have ranked them) deale herein moſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably and unworthily, and do offer ſuch an affront to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as in no one thing, more or a greater opprobrie.</p>
                     <p>I think now of the Inſtitution of <hi>Marriage,</hi> how ſacred that was, the honour and dignitie of the ſame, and how this Miniſter hath abaſed himſelf, and vilified this ſacred ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and now I commend him to the eye of the civill <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and from his hand, to the hand of his fellow <hi>Miniſter,</hi> the <hi>hang-man</hi> I mean, for, I pray for him, That he may ſuffer as a notorious malefactour: Becauſe he doth moſt notoriouſly abuſe his office, ſcandalize his ſacred <hi>order;</hi> and, which is yet worſe, doth more hurt to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, then hath the moſt notorious <hi>Rogue</hi> in Newgate. I am very ſenſible and ſure of what I ſay. The ſervant before ſpoken of, muſt be remembred too; the Cart or Bride-well is a fit puniſhment for her, but too eaſie a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſuch an one, who, for a trifle, will hazard the caſting away her Maſters jewell.

                     <p>And here I muſt tell alſo, what I have ſeen and obſerved further, which is; That croſſes have preſently followed the concluſion of the match, which one ſide gave ſecret allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance unto, in hope of advancing their Childe; either a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeparation hath followed; The ſonne hath been poſted away into ſome forrein Countrey, elſe ſome ſtrangeneſſe of affection; for ſuch love is quickly cold, <hi>bird like</hi> (as <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>

                     <p>
                        <q>Look wherein a man expects the greateſt good (and his expectation is larger in no other thing, then in marriage, being moſt ancient, important, fundamentall to a ſweet ſocietie of life, and a great number of mutuall obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and profitable offices flowing thence) therein now, in a buſineſſe of ſo high concernment; Let a man proceed in the greateſt evidence and cleareneſſe of dealing, not ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one jot, or haires breadth from the wayes of ſinceritie and truth;</q> This is the direction, and I would have it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence my minde, when my tongue cannot.</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:204556:211"/> with death; that, if there be an errour at firſt, it is hardly recoverable afterwards; conſidering all this; I, that might command thee, do intreat thee, by that worthy name called upon Thee, and thy ſacred vow then given; By all the engagements of a childe; ſuch be all thy parents tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell for thy good: By all the comforts thou canſt hereafter look for; Be well adviſed firſt before thou doeſt proceed in this great buſineſſe, which requires ſuch and ſo much deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration; Be, I ſay, well adviſed firſt; By whom? not by thine own heart, aske not counſell there, it may be, and is in ſuch caſes, ſtrangely corrupted; nor by thine own eare, there is prejudice; nor eye, that is blinded; nor affections, they are troubled, and can give no certain anſwer; Nor by thy ſelf, for now thou art not thy ſelf; Thy judgement and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are quite ſteeped in affection <note n="k" place="margin">Affectiones facile faciunt opiniones.</note>. Yeeld thy ſelf wholly up, to thoſe, who have the overſight and charge over thee, that is my charge; There leave this great buſineſſe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; Here ſhew thy obedience as thou lookeſt to proſper.</p>
                     <p>All thy deportment, from the yeares of underſtanding and onward, thy geſture, thy words, thy actions, ſhould all, at all times, ſweetly and child-like ſpeake out, and ſhew forth thy dutie to, &amp; due obſervance of thy parents; So as all that look on thee, may heare and reade it in thy whole carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and all ſhort enough to anſwer thy debt.

I will read a ſhort ſtory here, wherein we ſhall ſee a great example of a childes dutie at this point; The greater the perſon was, the greater the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is: yet not ſo great the perſon, in reſpect of <hi>place</hi> and <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;</hi> but we are greater then he in reſpect of <hi>name</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;</hi> And therefore, if we Chriſtians fall ſhort at this point, our diſobedience will be, as the more notorious, ſo the more abominable. <hi>Xenophon</hi> relates the ſtory thus; <hi>Inſtit.

And but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall it is, and very reaſonable, that ſo it ſhould be; for, if the Parents will determine nothing till they <hi>aske the maide</hi> 
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 24. 57, 58.</note>, (whereof afterwards) how unchild like were it (to ſay no more) for the maide to ſay, or do, any thing till ſhe aske the Parents? <q>
                           <hi>Eſau</hi> was a bad Childe of a good Father, and he ſhewed (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome)</hi> his <hi>untowardneſſe</hi> betimes, for he <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> matched himſelf, without his Parents co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent.

                        <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 26. 35.</note>. And certainly if we grieve the hearts of our good Parents, we do, in ſo doing, block up our own way to our deſired bleſſing: ſo then, the beſt counſell I can give, and the beſt proviſion a childe can make againſt this great and ſolemne time, and for the better ſucceſſe in this great buſineſſe is; to look carefully, firſt to its <hi>ſingle charge;</hi> And then to leave the reſt to them, whoſe charge it is, and have taken upon them faithfully to diſcharge the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is a Childes principall dutie, <hi>This ruling of one well,</hi> The diſcharging of that <hi>little great-Cure,</hi> ſo as a man (ſouls have no ſexes, as was ſaid) may quit himſelf, like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in that ſingle account. This I ſay, is every ſingle. Bodies principall dutie; Therefore of this firſt.</p>
                     <p>1. We are by nature ambitious of rule, like the Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the more unfit to govern others, the more deſirous. We love to be in authoritie, and have others under us, before we
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:204556:212"/> have got command over our ſelves. We would take upon us, the charge of more ſouls (ſo doth He or She, that enter into this condition, and they muſt be accountable for them too, the greateſt cure in the world) before we know how weightie the charge of one <hi>ſoul</hi> is. Marriage is an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate, and if well ordered, there is nothing in the world more beautifull; And that it may be ſo, we muſt be well ordered before-hand, as befits the honour due to ſo ſweet a ſocietie; And it were well if our ſufficiency this way, and means for the well ordering of our ſelves, were well tryed (as in ſome Common-wealthes it hath been) before we are ſuffered to enter into ſo holy an order: unbrideled humours and unreclaimed deſires are not fit for this ſtrait bond. This band is ſtraite, and of any band holds in the ſhorteſt, how ever we may think the contrary; neither our own will, nor the libertie we may take, but right judgement, ſanctified reaſon, and expediency muſt guide us; elſe that, which ſhould ſuppreſſe ſinne, may increaſe and foment it: and that, which in true uſe doth refreſh and comfort, will weaken and exhauſt nature.</p>
                     <p>They that marry, marry not for themſelves but for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, family, friends: matters of great importance and of great burden; But few there are that conſider it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and therefore few that carry themſelves, as befitteth the ordinance, orderly and honourably in it, whence it comes to paſſe, that that which is the greateſt good, proves the greateſt evill, the fuell of ſinne, and matter of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſcontent.</p>
                     <p>A man may live to fortie or fiftie yeares, and yet be very unadviſed here; and ſo run on as the moſt do, of whom we may ſay; <hi>they know not what they do.</hi> A due conſideration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, and care how to diſcharge this <hi>ſingle cure</hi> would prevent all this, and ſet a man in a ready way for a future bleſſing. It was uſefully anſwered to a friend deſirous to know his friends reſolution, how fit it was for him being a ſingle man to change his condition: <q>If your own deſires (ſaid his friend) finde you work enough to reclaime and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:204556:212"/> keep them in; you had beſt forbeare yet to take upon you more work in the charge over others: If it be an hard taske to ſteere your little boat in a little River, it is not ſafe to venter your little skill in ſteering a ſhip through a wide Sea <note n="m" place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words imply but thus much; That every ſingle perſon muſt examine himſelf well and ſeriouſly in this point; how he hath diſcharged his ſingle account; how he hath ordered his little houſe, himſelf. And if he fall ſhort here, as certainly, if he deceive not himſelf, he will finde himſelf ſhort enough; Then he or ſhe (but we reſpect not ſexes) muſt think it as well a mercy, as the very reaſon that God doth not truſt them with <hi>more;</hi> their unfaithfulneſſe would be the more, and their account the greater: He that is not faithfull in a little, will not be faithfull in more, nor ſhall he have much committed unto him.</p>
                     <p>This intends every ſingle bodies inſtruction, more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thine; Take a ſpeciall charge (my childe) over thy ſelf, rule well thine own houſe, I mean thy ſelf; God hath made every man a governour there. The poore man, that hath none to govern, yet may be a king in himſelf. When thou haſt learnt to rule thy own ſpirit, thou wilt be fitter to be ſubject to anothers, and to rule others alſo.

                     <p>I think now of the ſad and heavy conſequences here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from: So long as my childe hath a principle of life to carry her to Church, let her not be borne thither as upon others ſhoulders; for ſhe matches for her ſelf principally, and for her life; let it be with her full conſent.</p>
                     <p>4. It is proper to the parents charge, and it is a point of their wiſdome alſo, to be watchfull herein, that the parties have as little ſight one of the other, as well may be, till there be ſome likelihood of proceeding.

Young folk are good at the latter, they will conclude quickly, they are quick at diſpatch: but in point of foreſight they are no body. They ſpell the rule backward, they diſpatch firſt, and deliberate afterwards; which cauſeth ſo much trouble in the houſe, and ſorrow in the world. They think not, what they do, they <hi>do to eternitie.</hi> Parents muſt <hi>balaſt</hi> them here, for they are like a ſhip without it: Parents muſt foreſee and forecaſt with all their eyes, and more if they had them, before young folk go to farre in this buſineſſe. Let this objection be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; <hi>I muſt eat good ſtore of ſalt with him or her firſt, whom I would make my friend afterwards;</hi> There is ſome uſe in it, but not here betwixt young parties. If their affections meet for the preſent, they examine not, what may cauſe a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement hereafter. Let the parents look to that, and judge of their diſpoſitions; they may do it, and they ought; the younger parties, cannot, their judgement is ſteeped in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as was ſaid, they have little diſcerning further then as may fit the preſent; but one or both can ſo intangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and very quickly, that if the match ſhould break,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:204556:215"/> the weaker breaks with it, and carrieth the trouble of it to the grave. I have obſerved it ſo alſo; and I tell no more, but mine own obſervations all along.

                     <p>5.

                     <p>And here we require the parents care and circumſpection, at no point or circumſtance more wanting; yet at no time more needfull, for it is the laſt and chief point of their duty, and evidenceth what their ſinceritie hath been in all they did before, touching their proceeding in and concluding the match: They muſt remember now, and conſider with all conſideration, <hi>That they are on this ſolemne day laying the foundation of a new houſe, or familie;</hi> now we know, what care we take in laying the foundation: They are now ſo joyning two, that they make two one; and this they can do by joyning hands, but there is but <hi>One,</hi> and He onely, that can joyn hearts, and keep them joyned; That marries them to Himſelf, and each to other, making them that day, and all their dayes of <hi>one heart in one houſe.</hi> This is a great work, and peculiar to Him, who is <hi>one God bleſſed for ever.</hi> Therefore a main point of circumſpection it is, that they do nothing this day whereby to offend His eyes, who gave them their childe, all that is lovely and comfortable in their childe; all the good they have, or can expect: Who makes a <hi>Vnitie,</hi> and keeps a <hi>Vnitie</hi> in the bond of peace.

                     <p>And ſo much, Childe, for thy better proviſion and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:204556:217"/> for this great and ſolemne buſineſſe; <hi>Of convenient entrance into this honourable eſtate,</hi> wherein I have diſcovered the great abuſes and diſorders about it, for thy better warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the more to engage thee to thy <hi>duty,</hi> which was twofold: <hi>The well looking to thy ſelf, thy ſingle cure, and then looking up to God, leaving the reſt in their hands, who are thy parents, or deputed ſo to he;</hi> What their charge is, we have heard, even their five fold duty.</p>
                     <p>It follows now, that I adde ſomething touching our Chriſtian-like managing this worthy and honourable eſtate; as befitteth the <hi>honour</hi> of it, whereon depends our comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able living in it.</p>
                     <p>2. We ſuppoſe now, that affections at the firſt meeting <note place="margin">II. §.</note> are ſtrongeſt, like a ſpring-tide; there are ſome certain fluſhes, as I may ſay, of Love, and Ioy, from the preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment each of other. Here then is required more wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then we have to moderate our affections (now in their hot fit) and to temper them with knowledge and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion: For this we muſt know, that there is as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt theſe ſudden fluſhes of love, and a well grounded affection, as is betwixt the burning heat of a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the naturall heat of a ſound and healthy body.</p>
                     <p>It is of ſoveraigne uſe to help us in the guiding the ſtream of our affections in the right channell, to conſider; Who it is, that makes the Creature ſo ſuitable, lovely and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; who it is, I ſay, that adorns and beautifies both the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> and the <hi>Bride.</hi> To forget this, ſeems as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, as it is impoſſible for a <hi>maid to forget her ornament, or a Bride</hi> her attire <note n="f" place="margin">Jer. 2. 32.</note>. And if it be remembred, it will beget ſome reciprocation, both of affection and duty, to Him, from whom we have all our comelineſſe <note n="g" place="margin">Ezek. 16. 14.</note>, and the ſtream of our affections will run right; <hi>We ſhall greatly rejoyce in the Lord, for he hath clothed us with the garments of ſalvotion, He hath covered us with the robe of righteouſneſſe, as a Bridegroom deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf with ornaments, and as a Bride adorneth her ſelf with her jewells</hi> 
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Iſa. 61. 10.</note>.</p>
                     <p>And it will help alſo much to advance our affections that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:204556:217"/> way, where our treaſure is or ſhould be, if we conſider that expreſſion, then which, there is not another more feeling one in all the ſacred Scripture (except in the 103 pſalme verſe the 13.) <hi>As the Bridegroom rejoyceth over his Bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee</hi>

                     <p>This conſideration would much help us in the keeping our hearts to God, the ſole fountain of life and happineſſe; and from cleaving to the Creature, which at the beſt, is but as a <hi>Ciſterne</hi>

And then the more we ſhall enlarge and widen our hearts towards it, the more the Creature may contract, and narrow it ſelf towards us, for our juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo, the heart, finding a capacitie in it ſelf, and a narrowneſſe in the Creature, it would finde ſo large content in, but cannot, nor is it poſſible it ſhould, there groweth a ſatietie, then a flatneſſe, then perhaps a coldneſſe: whereas a true and orderly love would have kept it ſelf in life and heat, and have maintained a good proportion in both, &amp;c <note n="l" place="margin">

                     <p>But now, this Chriſtian likt bearing of troubles, this carrying our burdens patiently, and as we ſay, lightly and merrily away, it ſuppoſeth two main things;</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p>And the way to come to a through mortification, (I ſpeak of an ordinary way) is to begin to deny thy ſelf in ſmall matters, thou ſhalt the eaſier do it in great. If we cannot forſake a cup of wine <note n="m" place="margin">See firſt part. p. 84.</note>; or beere which is not needfull for us; we ſhall never be able to forſake, husband, childe, houſe, land, for Chriſts ſake.

                     <p>It followes now, that I give ſome rules for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſnares, they fall under two heads, <hi>Snares from Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Snares from Wants;</hi> All along we ſhall finde our way is ſtrawed with them: for ſuch are our natures, either wee finde them in our way, or we lay them there; even our good things we make ſnares unto us; for prevention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, theſe are the rules.</p>
                     <p>If riches increaſe, we know our rule; And if God give thee a Child, thats our rule alſo; Thou muſt not ſet thy heart upon them, or this. It is a reſolved caſe, <hi>If thou wouldſt keepe thy Child, ſacrifice it</hi> (in thy affections, I meane:) elſe it will be a ſnare, and cauſe unto thee no ordinary ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, becauſe thy affection was extraordinary to it, ſo as thou couldeſt not ſacrifice it, according to the Rule: for whatſoever lyeth next thy heart, except Chriſt, will cauſe the breaking of thy heart with worldly ſorrow, which worketh death. There are two things that break the hearts of parents, they are; <hi>When the Child lives ill; or dyes too ſoone.</hi> Thou ſhalt be armed againſt theſe ſorrowes, at leaſt thou ſhalt not be hurt by them, if, whileſt thou haſt the Child, thou art as if thou hadſt it not: and, having it, if thou doeſt thy utmoſt to it, that may make thee to rejoyce for the Time to come. But hereof in the firſt part, which I will not recall here.</p>
                     <p>The ſame we may ſay of riches, <hi>If thou wouldſt keepe them, forſake them, deny them:</hi> Get thine heart from off them, then
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:204556:227"/> they can be no ſnare. It is notable, which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith <note n="y" place="margin">De Civit. lib.</note>, <hi>No man holdeth Chriſt, but by confeſſing Him; no man keepeth his Gold, but by denying the ſame:</hi> If I lay up <note place="margin">1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</note> money as a Treaſure, I ſhut out Chriſt; and in ſo doing I cauſe a rent in my ſoule as wide as Heaven, a <hi>breach</hi> like <hi>the Sea</hi> 
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Lam. 2 23.</note>. The World ſtands in a <hi>Diametrall,</hi> a direct oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt, as two contrary <hi>Maſters;</hi> we cannot <hi>leane</hi> to the <hi>One,</hi> but we muſt <hi>turne from</hi> the other; We cannot <hi>imbrace</hi> the <hi>One,</hi> but we muſt <hi>hate</hi> the other: the heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hang betwixt heaven and earth in an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> like two ſcales equally poyſed: if the world be at our foote, and under it, then Chriſt is exalted, and ſo on the contrary. With all thy care then keep the earth, and the things of the earth in their place, <hi>under foote:</hi> Bee in the world, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it not, hug it not. Vſe the world as travellers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes (ſuch are we;) they uſe things in their paſſage as they may further them towards their journeys end: They ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodly houſes, and much good land, but they fixe not on them, they ſuffer them to paſſe, becauſe their minde is on their countrey, the place where they would be.</p>
                     <p>I remember what is ſtoryed of a People, whoſe countrey we only read of, as we do of <hi>Platoes</hi> common-wealth; It is a fiction, but I intend the uſe: <hi>They had of gold and ſilver good ſtore to make their neceſſary proviſion with all, but none for oſtentation or ſhew to adorn their cubbords; what could be ſpared from their very neceſſaries, they muſt make thereof veſſells of diſhonour, ſuch as we ſet at our foot, in plain Engliſh,</hi> Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots, <hi>or the like. And there was this good in it (ſaid the merry Knight)</hi>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:204556:228"/> the reaſon, the other neceſſarily followes: For if we would not have our riches a ſnare unto us, then as they muſt be ſet at the <hi>foot,</hi> ſo Chriſt muſt be embraced as the onely <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> and ſo laid to heart. And this will be, if we conſider this to purpoſe, which followes: He made himſelfe <hi>poore,</hi> to make us <hi>rich;</hi> he <hi>emptyed</hi> himſelfe, to <hi>fill</hi> us; he <hi>ſtript</hi> himſelf, to <hi>cloath</hi> us; he was <hi>wounded,</hi> that by his ſtripes we might be <hi>healed;</hi> He was made a <hi>curſe,</hi> that we might be made a <hi>bleſſing;</hi> He <hi>died,</hi> that we might <hi>live.</hi> If we think on this, nothing can ſeeme too much to do, nor too heavy to ſuffer for Him. I remember a lovely anſwer of a Wife to her Husband; And becauſe a ſtory depends upon it, I will ſet down the whole relation, which is this; <note n="c" place="margin">

                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:204556:237"/> That what ever comfort thou haſt had in thy life time, from Him thou receivedſt it, who puts in all the Sugar and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light we finde, in or from the Creature; as Ayre lights not without the Sunne, nor wood heats without fire, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any condition comfort without God; and with Him every condition is comfortable, though ſeemingly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo diſcomfortable, for He moderateth the diſcomfort (it is like thou haſt found it ſo) ſo as we are not <hi>ſwallowed up of ſorrow;</hi> and He faſhioneth the heart to that diſconſolate condition, and that condition to the heart; ſo much, it is very likly, thou haſt found alſo, and it requires thy ſad and ſerious conſideration.</p>
                     <p>But more eſpecially, this thou muſt conſider, what have been the effects and fruits of all this goodneſſe? What thou haſt returned to the Lord for all theſe? All theſe, what are theſe? Nay, it is not poſſible to reckon them up: They that keepe a <hi>Regiſter</hi> of Gods mercies (ſome doe) cannot ſet downe all the Receits of one Day, much leſſe of all their dayes; ſo great is the ſumme of every particular day, that we cannot reckon up the ſpecialties thereof, and call them by their names, as God doth the Starres. But put it to the Queſtion; and let thy heart make anſwer before him, who tryeth the heart, and ſearcheth the reines, and will bring every ſecret thing to judgment.</p>
                     <p>The Oyle and radicall Balſome of thy life we ſpake of; hath it been fuell to thy Thankfulneſſe, or hath it increaſed the fire of thy luſts? Thou haſt been preſerved and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo long and ſo miraculouſly, as thou haſt heard and ſeene. How hath Gods patience, and longſuffering wrought upon thee? Hath it brought thee nearer to repentance, and ſo nearer to God? Or hath thine heart been hardned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (becauſe ſentence againſt an evill worke is not preſently <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8. 11.</note> executed:) So as, with that ſtubborne people, whoſe ſonnes and daughters naturally we are; thou mayſt ſay, <hi>I have been delivered to doe more abominations</hi> 
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Ierem. 7. 10.</note>. Thou haſt had mercies upon mercies, they have been new unto thee every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and for thy <hi>Sorrowes,</hi> they have been mitigated too,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:204556:237"/> and ſo mixed, that there was much mercy in them, many ingredients of comfort, to take of the ſharpneſſe, and allay the bitter reliſh thereof. What ſtrong workings haſt thou found herefrom? How haſt thou been inclined to love the Lord for His goodneſſe, to feare Him for His Mercies? How haſt thou been melted thereby to obedience, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged upon his Service? Aske thy ſelfe againe (for in that Method we went:) Thou haſt two hands, another hath but one, or, perhaps, none; what more worke haſt thou done? Thou haſt a Tongue, and the uſe of the ſame; there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou knoweſt who hath a Tongue, but ſpeakes not, wherein haſt thou glorified thy Maker more then the other hath done? Thou haſt two eyes, thy Neighbour is darke; Aske the ſame queſtion over againe: For, as it was ſaid of him, who was borne blind; <hi>So it was, that the workes of God</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 3. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhould be made manifeſt in him:</hi> So we may ſay, we have our eyes, eares, tongues, hands, which others have not; That we might the more ptaiſe the Lord for His goodneſſe, and declare His workes toward the children of men.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the queſtions, but upon the point, it is but this ſingle queſtion, and the very ſame, and to the ſame purpoſe, which the King makes (to that I doe allude) touching <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay; What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecay</hi> 
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Eſther 6. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>for this?</hi> So let this be the queſtion. What honour, what ſervice hath been done to the Lord? He hath ſo honoured thee; he hath ſo ſerved thee; be hath ſo and ſo preſerved thee, from the Paw of the Lyon, and jaw of the beare ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered thee. Through his ſtrength thou didſt leap over ſuch a wall, He brought thee out of ſuch a ſtrait; He ſupported thee in ſuch weakneſſes; He ſupplyed thee in ſuch a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; He gave ſucceſſe to thee, in ſuch buſineſſes. What ſhall I ſay, for we are confounded here; He is the God, not of ſome, but of <hi>all conſolations;</hi> the <hi>Father of mercies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> And we can no more number them, then we can the drops of the raine or of the dew; or the Treaſures of the ſnow and baile, but we know, who is the Father of them, and out of whoſe Bowels theſe mercies come; whereby thou haſt been fed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:204556:238"/> all thy life long, and redeemed from evill: we know the <hi>price</hi> of them too, the very leaſt of them, is the <hi>price of bloud.</hi> What honour hath been done for all this? What peculiar Service; thats the ſingle queſtion. If now thy heart make anſwer, as we read in the foregoing place, <hi>There is nothing done,</hi> no peculiar ſervice at all: inſtead of being the <hi>Temple of His praiſe,</hi> thou haſt been the <hi>grave of His mercies;</hi> They have been buried in thee, they have brought forth no fruits; if this be the anſwer of thy heart, and ſo it condemne thee, the Lord is greater then our hearts, He will condemn much more.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it is high time, to look into the Regiſter of Gods mercies, into the books of record; And if theſe mercies have laine as things caſt aſide, and of no account, as dead things out of minde; if ſo long and to this day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, then now it is high time, that thy <hi>reſt ſhould be troubled,</hi> and ſleep ſhould not come into thy eye; till thou haſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over this Regiſter, and recorded the mercies of the Lord; and ſo preſſed them on thy conſcience, That it may anſwer out of a pure heart, that ſomething at the length is done, ſome ſacrifice of praiſe and thanks is returned to the Lord for all this.</p>
                     <p>This is the firſt thing to be done now, and it is high time to do it, Conſidering the ſeaſon: It is ſuppoſed that <hi>gray haires</hi> are upon thee, here and there they are <hi>ſugared now,</hi> and like the <hi>hoary froſt;</hi> The <hi>Almond</hi> tree flouriſheth, thou art in the winter of thine age; It is high time now to look about thee, and to conſider. That is the firſt ground of conſideration.</p>
                     <p>2. That time is haſting, whoſe portion and burden from the Lord is <hi>but labour and ſorrow:</hi> And then, though we have time; for our day laſteth while life laſteth, yet no time to do any thing in it to purpoſe, for then the <hi>Graſſe-hopper is a burden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So I make two <hi>periods</hi> of this age, And each a ground to preſſe on unto a timely conſideration: The one I call <hi>decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning age,</hi> when we have lived almoſt to <hi>threeſcore</hi> yeares; The other, when we are drawing onward to <hi>foureſcore,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:204556:238"/> 
                        <hi>extreame old age;</hi> of both in their order. </p>
                     <p>1. Both the one as well as the other, is an age not more deſired then complained of; They knew beſt why, that feele the burden of it (I have not lived unto it; It is likely, that perſon complained not without cauſe, who being willed to haſten her pace, told them, who were ſo quick with her, <q>That ſo ſhe could not do, for ſhe carryed a great burden on her back; And whereas no burden at all appeared to the eye, ſhe replyed again, <hi>that threeſcore years were paſſed over her head and that was the burden,</hi> Plaut.</q> And ſo it may well be with thoſe, whoſe ſpirits are much ſpent, and ſtrength waſted, even at thoſe yeares; And then age it ſelf alone, is a burden. I can ſpeake little here out of experience. But this I can ſay; If God be pleaſed to ſtretch out my day ſo long, I ſhall know no cauſe to complain of the length, for that is a bleſſing; <hi>Length of dayes is from the right hand,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Riches and honour from the left.</hi> Only we muſt note here, That if the Lord be pleaſed to ſhorten the day of this life to any perſon, as ſometimes He doth to His deareſt and moſt obedient children (their dayes are not long upon earth) why yet, if He eek out this ſhort day here, with an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of dayes, and pleaſures at His right hand, when they are taken hence; if ſo, that partie ſhall have no cauſe to complaine of a ſhort day on earth, ſo abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed in heaven. This is a note by the way.</p>
                     <p>If, I ſay, God be pleaſed to ſtretch forth my dayes ſo long, I know no cauſe, why I ſhould complaine of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; I may complaine, and juſt cauſe why I ſhould, and that bitterly, but not for the acceſſion of yeares. If any thing ſower them, it is of mine owne <hi>Leaven,</hi> and of my owne putting in; Complaine of my ſelfe I may, of them I may not.</p>
                     <p>Old age is a calme, quiet, and eaſie time, if youth have done it no diſſervice, in filling its bones before hand; Nor no intemperance hath weakned its head or feete. If ſo, Old age hath juſt cauſe to complaine of the Man, not the man of Old Age.</p>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:204556:239"/>
                     <p> There is no Gueſt in the world, that is more deſired and expected, and yet, when it comes, worſe welcomed, and entertained, then <hi>Old Age is;</hi> ſtill with ſighes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; which, we know, argues bad welcome. I would have my Child make good proviſion for it, againſt it come, and when it is come, to give it good welcome. Welcome, I ſay, I doe not ſay, <hi>eaſe.</hi> Good welcome doth conſiſt (we ſay) in ſhewing a good and chearefull countenance to our gueſt, not in giving him too much eaſe, or feeding him too daintily. Let it appeare, thou haſt laid up ſtore againſt thy yeares come; and now they are come, thou canſt welcome them, and art glad they are come; but doe not make too-much of them, in giving them too much eaſe; I may warne thee of it againe, for Old Age is very craving, very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate that way; though they may be importunate. If thou yeeldeſt to a litherneſſe, and a liſtneſſes, whereto Old Age inclineth us very much, and ſo to ſpare thy body, thy activeneſſe will decay more in one moneth, then otherwiſe it would in twelve.

                     <p>The many decayes &amp; infirmities, that accompany this age, are fully ſet down by the preacher, Eccleſ. 12.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:204556:242"/> gate the more burdenſome: The words may imply alſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common conſtruction; that every thing, even the lighteſt, to an old man, is <hi>burdenſome:</hi> If he creep up to his bed and down from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though to repaire his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes, yet even this is burdenſome; even <hi>delights</hi> (to others) to him are tireſome; he takes no delight in the <hi>Graſhopper,</hi> nay it is a burden; that is, (ſaith <hi>Tremellius)</hi> that pleaſant ſeaſon of the yeer when we heare the Graſhopper, yeelds no pleaſure to him, none at all; he hath quite loſt his taſte and <hi>reliſh</hi> now in thoſe things, which to others are pleaſurable. &amp;c. And yet if the grave meet us not in our way hitherto (as commonly it doth before we come ſo farre) and prevent our expectation; it is larger in nothing, then in the iſſue of this age, and in the account, we hope to give up at that time. This is our greet folly; For, how bad ſtewards ſoever we have been of our fore paſt time, yet at this time, we hope to lay our reckonings even, and ſo to give up our <hi>account with joy.</hi> Though we have <hi>turned</hi> from God all our dayes, yet we have a ſure and certain hope, (in our conceit) that we ſhall <hi>turn</hi> unto Him, and He will <hi>turn</hi> unto us, at this time, when indeed we are not able to turn our ſelves upon our bed. And naturally (for it is but Nature ſeeking its own preſervation) naturally, I ſay, and uſually men do make fair <hi>offers, eſſayes</hi> and <hi>promiſes</hi> this way, at ſuch a time as this, when they ſee themſelves dropping into the grave.

Know they what they ſay? doe they conſider what death is, and the conſequence of the ſame; when once death hath made its laſt conqueſt over the Body, in that very inſtant Time, the ſoule enters into a condition never to be altered; it enters into eternity; a gulfe of Time, which all the figures in Arithmeticke cannot fill up. For when we have reckoned a thouſand thouſand yeares, we <note place="margin">Read <hi>Drexcli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> 4. 2.</note> have not the fewer remaining. We are ſwallowed up in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:204556:245"/> the thought of Eternity, as a drop in the Ocean; It is not poſſible to finde any bottome there; we want a thought to meaſure it, but if we ſhould thinke of it to purpoſe, we ſhould be well adviſed what we doe or ſay.

                     <p>It was well anſwered by a Father to his Sonne, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Croſſed</hi> in his humor, wiſhed <hi>hee were dead; learne firſt what it is to live;</hi> he that ſo lightly wiſheth to dye, is as he that flyeth from an <hi>yron weapon, and a bow of ſteele ſtriketh him through,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh <note n="l" place="margin">Job. 20. 24.</note>: <hi>Woe unto you, that deſire the day of the Lord, to what end is it for you</hi>

For the nature of Death is changed to the godly; <hi>It is harmeleſſe now, and hath loſt its venome; It is a paſſage to a better place, a gate to Glory; It is the accompliſhment of Mortification, and the end of labour.</hi> Thus death is, but not in its owne nature; ſo it is a deſtroying hoſtile thing, and ſo to our nature, the moſt <hi>terrible</hi> of <hi>all Terribles;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be deſired, till we are aſſured, that both the nature thereof, and our nature alſo is changed. And then alſo our deſires muſt not be immoderate; we muſt not long for it, nor rejoyce <hi>exceedingly,</hi> when <hi>we</hi> can <hi>finde</hi> the <hi>grave</hi> 
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Job 3. 21, 22.</note>.

And therefore no matter if yet longer they waite His Time, and abide His pleaſure, though with ſome griefe and paine to the fleſh; <hi>pleaſures at His right Hand for evermore,</hi> will abundantly recompenſe, what ever preſſures are from below.</p>
                     <p>But whether we dye ſooner or later, it is then ſafe dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we can yeeld up our ſpirits, as <hi>David</hi> did, and with the ſame confidence; <hi>Into thine Hand I commit my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>

The words of a dying man are nothing, and of no regard further then they receive weight and ſtrength from the actions of an healthy and ſound man, the <hi>living man:</hi> Therefore it matters not, what a ſick man can ſay for the future, but what he ſaith for the former time, for from thence he muſt fetch his comfort, as we heard, I <hi>have walked;</hi> I have <hi>done,</hi> I have <hi>fought,</hi> I <hi>have kept.

If our conſciences do condemne us (as a learned Spaniard phraſeth it) that <hi>we have made</hi> time <hi>of</hi> eternitie, <hi>and</hi> eternitie <hi>of</hi> time; that is (as he expounds it,) <hi>We have deſpiſed that eternall bliſſe, as if it were but</hi> temporall; <hi>and we have lodged all our love upon this</hi> tranſitory <hi>world, as if this had been the thing, which is</hi> eternall; And if ſo we have done, we can have no comfort then, when our <hi>tranſitories</hi> are leaving us, in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forwards towards eternitie; We may ſend our ſighs and groans after it, but in vain: Our hearts may beat ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards heaven, but all that may be much ſuſpected alſo;</p>
                     <p>It is of doubtfull conſtruction from what <hi>ſpirit</hi> our groanes do proceed; If it was thus once, when the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Temple was a laying; That the people could not diſcerne, the <hi>Noiſe of the ſhout of joy,</hi> from the noiſe of weeping <note n="e" place="margin">Ezra 3. 13.</note>, Then a harder matter it is, to diſcern betwixt <hi>groane</hi> and <hi>groane; ſighes</hi> and <hi>ſighes;</hi> I meane betwixt the ſighes and groans, which the <hi>ſpirit</hi> puts up, and thoſe which an heart pained, full of anguiſh, and drunk with ſorrow, ſends forth. Very hard it is to diſcern here, and to make a difference, nay impoſſible: for the groans from pain &amp; ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and the ſighes of the ſpirit, are both ſcarce utterable, and they are both put up in much bitterneſſe, and both call out of ſin, as the cauſe of All, which makes the diſcerning the more difficult.</p>

                        </note> I remember a pretty inverſion of order, uſed by <hi>Cicero</hi> in point of <hi>Oratory;</hi> An alluſion unto it may inſtruct us in a ſpeciall point of wiſdome; <hi>We begin firſt, and then wee end; But he made an end firſt, and then he began; I uſe,</hi> ſaith He to his Oratour, <hi>to make my beginning</hi> (the Latine calls it an <hi>Exordium) When I have ended my oration; for I muſt fetch that out of the Bowels of the other Parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The true Chriſtian makes an inverſon of order alſo, and upon the ſame ground. Death is the laſt great work which we are to doe, and the true Chriſtian thinks of that firſt; Firſt, I ſay, ſo ſoone as he is able to think any thing, and to purpoſe. And he ſo diſpoſeth his life, as one that knowes, that his life muſt yeeld him marrow and fatneſſe, when he lyeth upon his death Bed, in a time of drought. We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly live firſt, and then we dye; A true Chriſtian <hi>dyes firſt,</hi> and <hi>then lives.</hi> He is borne, and he goes on in the great work of Mortification, and ſo dyes daily. And then when he muſt yeeld up the ſpirit, how willing, how ready, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared is he? He is dead already to the World, to the fleſh, Hee is crucified to both, and both crucified to him. An eaſie matter now, and a matter of the greateſt comfort to depart hence now; now, that His eyes can behold His <hi>Salvation.</hi> Now He chooſeth Death rather then life, for to Him the nature thereof is changed; He hath ſo walked all His life, ſo contended for, and kept the Truth; ſo clinged to Chriſt in obedience and Faith, <hi>Who taſted Death for him</hi> 
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note>, that now He ſhall neither <hi>ſee</hi> Death, nor <hi>taſte</hi> Death; He ſhall not <hi>ſee</hi> Death, He ſhall <hi>ſee</hi> the face of Death changed, lovely and pleaſant now, as <hi>Eſau's</hi> face to <hi>Iacob;</hi> He ſhall ſee through the vaile and ſhadow of Death, through the darke Grave, and behold Him, who hath ſwallowed up Death, and the Grave in victory. He ſhall not <hi>Taſte</hi> Death: The ſharp and bitter reliſh of Death is quite allayed and taken off to Him now; He <hi>taſteth</hi> nothing but ſweetneſſe in Death, but joy and peace in Death, a peace paſſing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; He is ſwallowed up, now not of Death, but of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:204556:249"/> very <hi>Rivers, and Flouds, the Brookes of Honey, and Butter</hi> 
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Iob 20. 17.</note>. He doth not <hi>ſee</hi> Death, nor doth He <hi>taſte</hi> thereof, ſuch are the expreſſions <note n="l" place="margin">John 8. 51, 52.</note>, and they are to the <hi>heart</hi> of the Beleever; in Death now He ſeeth life, accompanied with an eternall waight of Glory. He lookes upon Death now, as <hi>Iacob</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ioſephs</hi> wagon <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 4. 5.</note>, which ſhall convey Him to a place, where He ſhall have <hi>Enough;</hi> ſo as He regards not the ſtuffe and baggage of the world; for the good, I ſay not, of all <note place="margin">Verſe 20.</note> the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> is His, but, Heaven is His, and all the good that Chriſt hath purchaſed is His. And now at this Brunt, (much like the ſtraight, that <hi>David</hi> was in but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the putting on of His Crowne;) at this brunt, I ſay, now that Death ſeemes to make His Conqueſt, it doth this Servant of the Lord the beſt good ſervice, for it ſhall open Him the way to the Crowne, it ſhall ſet free the <hi>priſoner of Hope,</hi> it ſhall be as a <hi>Waggon</hi> to convey Him unto the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of All good, even to Chriſt Himſelfe; and now I have ſaid All. And all this, this Servant of the Lord ſeeth in Death; and then how can this perſon <hi>Taſte</hi> of Death? ſince it muſt needs be that He can have no other reliſh in His heart now, but of honey and butter, of Pleaſures of Gods right Hand for evermore.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is with that perſon, who doth that work firſt, who in mortifying the deeds of the fleſh doth <hi>Dye Daily;</hi> When Death commeth he <hi>ſeeth it not, he taſteth not of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for the wicked, it is not ſo with them, They <hi>ſee death;</hi> They <hi>taſte of death.</hi> They ſee death and the horrour of it, they ſee it over-powring them, and getting now a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over them; they ſee it rouling great ſtones upon the mouth of their Cave, as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> upon the five Kings <note n="n" place="margin">Joſ. 10. 18.</note>, there reſerving them as <hi>Priſoners</hi> of <hi>no hope,</hi> till the day of their doome, when they ſhall receive that dreadfull, but juſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, under execution whereof they ſhall lye eternally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent to their <hi>own place,</hi> where, like ſlaves, Death ſhall keep them under perpetuall bondage. And there they muſt <hi>taſte</hi> of it alſo, even ſuch bitterneſſe, as ſhall be to them, as the <hi>gall of Aspes</hi> within their bowells, and the <hi>poyſon of Vipers;</hi>
                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:204556:249"/> Thus they taſte it, but it is beyond expreſſion; and this is the portion of them, that <hi>feare Him not,</hi> nor, in their ſeaſon, and Day of Viſitation, call upon His Name, even this is their Portion from the Lord, ſaith the Lord Almightie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But there is a ſweet peace in Death to all ſuch as pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerve the Lord in life;</q> they are the words of him, who relateth the laſt words of that excellent ſervant of the Lord M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dearing;</hi> And they were theſe.</p>

                     <p>This inſtructs us in this high point of Wiſdome, more then once pointed at before, but can never be ſufficiently preſſed, till it be thoroughly learnt, which is, to make uſe of the pteſent Time; to know the Day of our viſitation <note n="o" place="margin">Iob 22. 21.</note>; to acquaint our ſelves now with the Lord; to number our Dayes (God only teacheth the heart that Arithmeticke) that is, to conſider how ſhort, how tranſitory, how full of trouble our dayes are: And yet ſuch though they are but as a ſpan, yet thereon dependeth Eternity. The thought whereof might ſtirre up to the well improovement of them. The Hebrewes have a proverbe which they deliver in way of Counſaile, <hi>Good friend remember to repent one Day before thy Death.</hi> By one Day, they meant the preſent Time, the Day of Salvation.

                  <p>To put a full <hi>period</hi> hereunto, it will be neceſſary to take of an unjuſt imputation caſt upon <hi>Old-Age,</hi> by pleading her cauſe, and informing againſt her informers. Theſe are the precedent Ages, for thus they accuſe and deride this withered and decayed Age, telling us; <q>It is like a weather-beaten houſe dropping down, wherein none would dwell under ſuch Ruins.</q>

                  <p>True it is, ſuch a kinde of thing <hi>Old-Age</hi> may ſeeme to

They have been as <hi>violent winds,</hi> and <hi>ſtormes</hi> often beating upon this <hi>houſe</hi> of <hi>clay,</hi> and ſo have brought it out of reparations. <hi>Youth</hi> will pleaſe his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, that he will, come what will come; he will ſatisfie his youthfull deſires, though, in ſo doing, he doth exhauſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſpends upon the <hi>principall ſtock</hi> of life; which yet he thinks not of, for youth can beare it out, but it will fall to the Lot of the <hi>old man</hi> to want and ſmart for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p> It is very notable ſure, That the <hi>diſmiſſing</hi> the <hi>men,</hi> and the <hi>hanging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </note> perhaps, if <hi>Tremellius</hi> his interpretation be right, we cannot thereby conclude the preciſe time, when ſhe did hang it forth. But thus we conclude, for ſo we are taught; That ſhe uſed no delay, none at all, but when the time was <hi>fitting</hi> and <hi>convenient,</hi> then ſhe did it; and that might be preſently, at that inſtant, time as is ſpecified in the Text, for ought we can or may gather to the contrary. But what needed ſo much haſte? ſhe might have delayed <hi>the binding</hi> the <hi>line</hi> to the <hi>window,</hi> ſome dayes, for the <hi>Spies</hi> were not yet returned; <hi>Ioſhua</hi> was not yet upon his <hi>march; Iordan</hi> was betwixt; ſome time there muſt be in marching towards <hi>Iericho;</hi> and ſixe dayes they were <hi>compaſſing</hi> the Citie. Time enough to hang out the Threed, when ſhe heard, That the <hi>Trumpets blew,</hi> and, becauſe they were but <hi>ram's hornes,</hi> ſhe might have delayed yet longer, till the <hi>laſt day,</hi> when ſhe ſaw the <hi>walls fall down flat,</hi> and then ſhe might haſten to the window, and do that worke ſoone enough. Thus fleſh and bloud might reaſon the caſe, and very well ſatisfie a <hi>dilatory ſpirit.</hi> But it is of infinite uſe to conſider, That thus <hi>Rahab</hi> did not reaſon, but <hi>then, when ſhe ſent away the men, ſhe bound the ſcarlet line in the window.</hi> We cannot be too quick and ſpeedy in caſe of life and ſalvation. Here, delayes are dangerous, perhaps deadly. I may deferre this day and the next till my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be approaching and ſurpriſing me, and I finde my ſelfe falling down flat; this I may do, and yet do well. But it is very hazardous. It may, nay it is moſt likely, ſo it will be, if I ſtay till dangers have beſet me, and incompaſſed me, my feares will be ſuch, as that they will <hi>betray all my ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.</hi>
